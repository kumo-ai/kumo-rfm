User: I want to analyze housing market trends

Assistant: What specific aspects of the housing market are you interested in analyzing? For example, are you looking at housing prices, construction activity, or something related to consumer sentiment? 

Also, do you have any specific time period in mind (e.g. past 10 years, historical data only)?
