   Frequency: M
   Popularity: 99
   Notes:
    Daily Federal Funds Rate from 1928-1954 (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/categories/33951).

The federal funds rate is the interest rate at which depository institutions trade federal funds (balances held at Federal Reserve Banks) with each other overnight. When a depository institution has surplus balances in its reserve account, it lends to other banks in need of larger balances. In simpler terms, a bank with excess cash, which is often referred to as liquidity, will lend to another bank that needs to quickly raise liquidity. (1) The rate that the borrowing institution pays to the lending institution is determined between the two banks; the weighted average rate for all of these types of negotiations is called the effective federal funds rate.(2) The effective federal funds rate is essentially determined by the market but is influenced by the Federal Reserve as it uses the Interest on Reserve Balances rate to steer the federal funds rate toward the target range.(2)

The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meets eight times a year to determine the federal funds target range. The Fed's primary tool for influencing the federal funds rate is the interest the Fed pays on the funds that banks hold as reserve balances at their Federal Reserve Bank, which is the Interest on Reserves Balances (IORB) rate. Because banks are unlikely to lend funds in the federal funds market for less than they get paid in their reserve balance account at the Federal Reserve, the Interest on Reserve Balances (IORB) is an effective tool for guiding the federal funds rate. (3) Whether the Federal Reserve raises or lowers the target range for the federal funds rate depends on the state of the economy. If the FOMC believes the economy is growing too fast and inflation pressures are inconsistent with the dual mandate of the Federal Reserve, the Committee may temper economic activity by raising the target range for federal funds rate, and increasing the IORB rate to steer the federal funds rate into the target range. In the opposing scenario, the FOMC may spur greater economic activity by lowering the target range for federal funds rate, and decreasing the IORB rate to steer the federal funds rate into the target range. (3) Therefore, the FOMC must observe the current state of the economy to determine the best course of monetary policy that will maximize economic growth while adhering to the dual mandate set forth by Congress. In making its monetary policy decisions, the FOMC considers a wealth of economic data, such as: trends in prices and wages, employment, consumer spending and income, business investments, and foreign exchange markets.

The federal funds rate is the central interest rate in the U.S. financial market. It influences other interest rates such as the prime rate, which is the rate banks charge their customers with higher credit ratings. Additionally, the federal funds rate indirectly influences longer- term interest rates such as mortgages, loans, and savings, all of which are very important to consumer wealth and confidence.(2)

   Popularity: 9
   Notes:
   Data For 1858-1904, From Annual Reports Of Chicago Board Of Trade Are Given In Source By Weeks, That Is The Low And High For Each Week Ending Saturday Is Given. Monthly Averages Have Been Computed By NBER By Averaging All The Weekly Highs And Lows Falling Within Any One Month. The Usual Bureau 3-4 Method (Including A Week Ending On The 3Rd As Falling Within The Past Month) Has Not Been Followed In This Series. This New Precedent Is Taken From H.A. Wallace, "Agricultural Prices," Where This Method Is Used. Where Figures Are Omitted In The Source, Whether Highs Or Lows, The Missing Figures Have Been Filled By The Average Of The Remaining Highs Or Lows, Respectively, Thus Giving Always Equal Weights To The Number Of High And Low Quotations. The Grades Quoted Change From Time To Time, But Except In 1900, They Appear To Be Comparable, This Sometimes Shown By Overlaps. The Change From 1899 To 1900 Was A Jump Of Several Grades, That Is, From 5-A To 2-A, Thus Making The 1900 Data On Too High A Level To Be Comparable With Previous Data. Therefore, From 1900 On, The United States Department Of Agriculture Figures Should Be Used. These Data Refer To Monthly Average Prices For Native Beef Steers, All Weights, 750-1800 Pounds, Compiled By The Chicago Daily Drovers Journal. Beginning With January, 1922, They Are Average Prices Of All Grades Compiled By United States Department Of Agriculture -- Native, Excluding Western. The Grades And Periods For The Chicago Board Of Trade Figures Are As Follows: 1858, No Description, Probably Fair To Choice; 1859-1873, Fair To Choice, 3-1; 1874-1875, Common To Choice, 4-1; 1876-1878, Good To Choice, 2-1; 1879-1884, Fair To Choice, 3-1; 1885, Common To Choice, 4-1; 1886-1899, Inferior To Prime, 5-A1; 1900-1904, Good To Extra, 2-A1.

Since all quits end in either unemployment or non-participation, one minus this time series will be the share of workers who leave into unemployment due to a quit.

Average consumer prices are calculated for household fuel, motor fuel, and food items from prices collected for the Consumer Price Index (CPI). Average prices are best used to measure the price level in a particular month, not to measure price change over time. It is more appropriate to use CPI index values for the particular item categories to measure price change.

Prices, except for electricity, are collected monthly by BLS representatives in the 75 urban areas priced for the CPI. Electricity prices are collected for the BLS for the same 75 areas on a monthly basis by the Department of Energy using mail questionnaires. All fuel prices include applicable Federal, State, and local taxes; prices for natural gas and electricity also include fuel and purchased gas adjustments.

   Frequency: M
   Popularity: 2
   Notes:
   Round steaks excluding USDA Prime and USDA Choice, regardless of cut. Includes bone-in, boneless, organic, non-organic, fresh, and frozen.

Average consumer prices are calculated for household fuel, motor fuel, and food items from prices collected for the Consumer Price Index (CPI). Average prices are best used to measure the price level in a particular month, not to measure price change over time. It is more appropriate to use CPI index values for the particular item categories to measure price change.

Prices, except for electricity, are collected monthly by BLS representatives in the 75 urban areas priced for the CPI. Electricity prices are collected for the BLS for the same 75 areas on a monthly basis by the Department of Energy using mail questionnaires. All fuel prices include applicable Federal, State, and local taxes; prices for natural gas and electricity also include fuel and purchased gas adjustments.

   Title: Real Gross Domestic Product: Private Industries: Construction for United States Metropolitan Portion
   Frequency: A
   Popularity: 1
   Notes:
   The term "Construction" is used in both the SIC system and in NAICS, but it does not have the same definition in both systems.

SIC definition: This SIC division includes establishments primarily engaged in construction. The term construction includes new work, additions, alterations, reconstruction, installations, and repairs. Construction activities are generally administered or managed from a relatively fixed place of business, but the actual construction work is performed at one or more different sites. If a company has more than one relatively fixed place of business from which it undertakes or manages construction activities and for which separate data on the number of employees, payroll, receipts, and other establishment-type records are maintained, each such place of business is considered a separate construction establishment.

Three broad types of construction activity are covered: (1) building construction by general contractors or by operative builders; (2) heavy construction other than building by general contractors and special trade contractors; and (3) construction activity by other special trade contractors.

NAICS definition: The Construction (NAICS) sector comprises establishments primarily engaged in the construction of buildings or engineering projects (e.g., highways an utility systems). Establishments primarily engaged in the preparation of sites for new construction and establishments primarily engaged in subdividing land for sale as building sites also are included in this sector.

Construction work done may include new work, additions, alterations, or maintenance and repairs. Activities of these establishments generally are managed at a fixed place of business, but they usually perform construction activities at multiple project sites. Production responsibilities in this sector are usually specified in (1) contracts with the owners of construction projects (prime contracts) or (2) contracts with other construction establishments (subcontracts).

Consists of all counties in a state that are parts of metropolitan statistical areas.
