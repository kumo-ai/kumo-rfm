   Title: Index of Stock Prices for France
   Frequency: M
   Popularity: 5
   Notes:
   This Series May Be Compared With The Annual Index Given In The May, 1928 Issue Of The Journal (Dessiner) For 54 Securities. Since The Movement Was Very Similar, This Series Was Adjusted Slightly To Have Its Annual Averages The Same As Those Of The Annual Series. This Index Was Felt To Be Superior Since It Covered A Larger Number Of Securities. 1. From Quotations Near The End Of Each Month: A. January, April, July, And October 1898 And Monthly From January, 1898-July, 1900 The Following Stocks Were Used: Banque De France, Banque De Paris, Banque Transatlantique, Acienes Du Nord Et De L'Est, Campaigne Francaise Des Metaux, Chantiers De La Loire, Thomson Houston, Dynamite Centrale, Lyon, Nord, Compagnie Generale Transatlantique, Gaz Pour La France Et L'Etranger, Compagnie Generale Des Eaux, Compagnie Parisienne Du Gaz, Printemps, Entrepots Et Magazins Generaux De Paris, Suez. The General Index Was Computed On The Base December, 1899=100. B. For July, 1900-December, 1901 The Mean Of The Indexes Is Of The Following Groups, On The Base January 1, 1900=100 (See Reforme Economique): French Credit Establishments (7 Securities); French Railways (6 Securities); Metallurgy And Mines (16 Securities); Transportation (10 Securities); Miscellaneous (7 Securities); Fire Insurance (5 Securities); Coal (30 Securities). C. December, 1901-December, 1905 Are After Price Quoted And Are Arithmetic Mean Of Indexes (On The Base June, 1903=100) Of 23 Securities (The 25 Quoted For The Period 1909-1914 Less Lens And Douyes). D. December, 1905-December, 1908 (On Base 1908=100), 41 Securities Are Used. These Include The 25 Used For 1909-1914 (See Below) And Credit Lyonnais, Comptoir D'Escompte, Bethune, Commentry--Four Chambault, Constructions Mecaniques, Electro Metallurgie De Drives, Chantiers De La De La Gironde, Phosphates De Gafsa, Orleans, Midi, Messagries Maortimes, Compagnie Francaise Et Continentale D'Eclairage, Forces Motrices Du Rhone, Entrepots Et Magazins Generaux De Paris, Printemps, Grande Moulirs De Corbeil. E. December, 1908-1914, 25 Securities (On The Base 1908=100). Banque De Paris, Banque De France, Lens, Dourges, Acieries De La Mariue, Chatillon--Commentary, Acieries Du Nord Et De L'Est, Fives--Lille, Trefileries Du Havre, Compagnie Francais Des Metaux, Chantiers De La Loire, Thomson--Houston, Dynamite Centrale, Lyon, Nord, Compagnie Generale Transatlantique, Union Des Gaz, Gaz Et Eaux, Eclairage Et Force Par L'Electricite, Secteur De Clichy, Compagnie Generale D'Electricite, Grand Hotel, Say, Boleo, Suez. "Les Mouvements Saisonniere Sont Apparus Nettement Dessines, Quoique Peu Important, Et Voici Ls Resultats De Ce Calcul. ....Que Nous Indiquens Comme Nettement Dessines Des Variations Saisonniere Pourtant Assez Faibles." Source, P.59. For 1919-1925, The Old Index Was Used. For 1926-1929, A Revision Of The Index, First Computed In January, 1922, Based Upon 194 Securities In 25 Groups, With Each Security Given The Weight Of 100 Francs In The Base Period 1901-1910. This Gave Rise To Certain Difficulties, Because As One Moves Away From The Base Period, Different Stocks Begin To Be Weighted Very Differently (And Not Necesarily Justifiably). What Was Done Then, Was To Compute For Each Security Its Value In January, 1926 When Referred To A Base Whose Base Was Its Average Value In 1925. These Were Then Averaged Together, So That Each Security Was Weighted Equally In 1925, And The Whole Group Then Referred Back To 1913. The Earlier Index (From 1919-1925) Was Kept The Same Except That It Was Converted From The Base 1901-1910 To 1913. But January, 1926 Of The New Index (From 1919-1925) Was Made Equal To The Old Index (211) And After January, 1926, The Series Referred To 288 Securities In 20 Groups. The Groups And The Number Of Securities Included In Each Group Are As Follows: Banks (13); Textile Industries (13); Insurance Companies (15); Railroads, Great Systems (10); Coal Mines Of The Center (7); Railroads, Miscellaneous And Urban Transport--France, Algeria, And Tunis (14); Coal Mines Of The North (11); Miscellaneous Mines--France, Algeria, And Tunis (9); Transportation--Water (9); Iron And Steel Works (13); Gas (12); Metal Works, Mechanical And Electrical Construction (24); Electricity (23); Diverse Industries (22); Shipbuilding (7); Miscellaneous Trading (16); Buliding Materials (11); Colonial Companies (25); Chemical Products (16); French Companies Operating Abroad (18). The Old Index Consisted Of These Groups And Number Of Securities Their Respective Numbers Of Securities: Banks And Credit Institutions (13); Miscellaneous French And Colonial Railroads (10); Coal Mines Of The Loire And Center (5); Urban Transport (6); Navigation (6); Docks And Piers (3); Coal Mines Of The North (10); Iron And Steel Works (10); Metal Mines (4); Suez Canal (1); Metals (4); Mechanical Construction (5); Gas (12); Shipbuilding (5); Water (4); Electricity (26); Materials And Miscellaneous"Ontillages" (4); Foodstuffs And Mineral Waters (13); Chemical Products--Salts And Phosphates (11); Building Materials (5); Printing (4); Department Stores (4); Foreign Railroads (8); Textiles (2); French Railroads, Major Systems (5). These Have Been Corrected For Changes In Capitalization And Distribution Of Reserves. See Bulletin, January, 1932, P.243 And Following, For 1932 Revisions. The Method And Base Remained The Same, But In 1929, The Number Of Securities Changed From 288 In 20 Groups To 300 In 22 Groups. The New Groups And The Respective Number Of Securities In Each Group Is As Follows: Banques (20); Railroads, Miscellaneous And Urban (13); Assurances (15); Hauilleres Du Centre (8); Navigation (9); Hauilleres Du Nord (11); Gas (12); Miscellaneous Mining (8); Electricity (21); Iron And Steel (13); Food--Alimentation (14); Mechanical Construction(24); Large Warehouses--Grands Magasins (8); Shipbuilding (6); Building Materials (13); Miscellaneous Industries (16); Chemical Products (16); Miscellaneous Trading (12); Textile Industry (16); Colonial Companies (20); Railroads, Large Systems (10); French Companies Operating Abroad(15).

   Title: Contributions to the Cleveland Financial Stress Index: Stock Market Crashes (DISCONTINUED)
   Frequency: D
   Popularity: 5
   Notes:
   In May of 2016, the source discovered errors in the calculation of the CFSI and began a detailed review of the index and its underlying model. Following that review, the source decided to discontinue the CFSI. https://www.clevelandfed.org/en/our-research/indicators-and-data/cleveland-financial-stress-index.aspx

The source has posted to their website a message regarding this release: Cleveland Financial Stress Index under review and a revised index expected in the fourth quarter of 2016. A thorough review of the index is being conducted to both simplify the index and enhance its robustness, while also taking into consideration changes in financial markets and institutions. This review and the revisions to the CFSI are expected to be completed sometime during the fourth quarter of this year, and additional details will be made available at that time. Thank you for your patience while we improve the CFSI.

This chart shows the contribution of the stock market crashes indicator to the CFSI. This indicator is measured as the ratio of the current value of the S&P 500 Financial Index relative to its maximum over the previous 365 days. It captures the extent to which equity values have dropped over the previous year. It also captures expectations about the future of the banking industry.

   Title: Velocity of M2 Money Stock
   Frequency: Q
   Popularity: 82
   Notes:
   Calculated as the ratio of quarterly nominal GDP (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GDP) to the quarterly average of M2 money stock (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2SL).

The velocity of money is the frequency at which one unit of currency is used to purchase domestically- produced goods and services within a given time period. In other words, it is the number of times one dollar is spent to buy goods and services per unit of time. If the velocity of money is increasing, then more transactions are occurring between individuals in an economy.
The frequency of currency exchange can be used to determine the velocity of a given component of the money supply, providing some insight into whether consumers and businesses are saving or spending their money. There are several components of the money supply,: M1, M2, and MZM (M3 is no longer tracked by the Federal Reserve); these components are arranged on a spectrum of narrowest to broadest. Consider M1, the narrowest component. M1 is the money supply of currency in circulation (notes and coins, traveler's checks [non-bank issuers], demand deposits, and checkable deposits). A decreasing velocity of M1 might indicate fewer short- term consumption transactions are taking place. We can think of shorter- term transactions as consumption we might make on an everyday basis.

Beginning May 2020, M2 consists of M1 plus (1) small-denomination time deposits (time deposits in amounts of less than $100,000) less IRA and Keogh balances at depository institutions; and (2) balances in retail MMFs less IRA and Keogh balances at MMFs. Seasonally adjusted M2 is constructed by summing savings deposits (before May 2020), small-denomination time deposits, and retail MMFs, each seasonally adjusted separately, and adding this result to seasonally adjusted M1. For more information on the H.6 release changes and the regulatory amendment that led to the creation of the other liquid deposits component and its inclusion in the M1 monetary aggregate, see the H.6 announcements (https://www.federalreserve.gov/feeds/h6.html) and Technical Q&As (https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h6/h6_technical_qa.htm) posted on December 17, 2020.


MZM (money with zero maturity) is the broadest component and consists of the supply of financial assets redeemable at par on demand: notes and coins in circulation, traveler's checks (non-bank issuers), demand deposits, other checkable deposits, savings deposits, and all money market funds. The velocity of MZM helps determine how often financial assets are switching hands within the economy.

   Calculated as the ratio of quarterly nominal GDP (GDP (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GDP)) to the quarterly average of M1 money stock (M1SL (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M1SL))

The velocity of money is the frequency at which one unit of currency is used to purchase domestically- produced goods and services within a given time period. In other words, it is the number of times one dollar is spent to buy goods and services per unit of time. If the velocity of money is increasing, then more transactions are occurring between individuals in an economy.

The frequency of currency exchange can be used to determine the velocity of a given component of the money supply, providing some insight into whether consumers and businesses are saving or spending their money.

Consider M1, the narrowest component. M1 is the money supply of currency in circulation (notes and coins, demand deposits, and other liquid deposits). A decreasing velocity of M1 might indicate fewer short- term consumption transactions are taking place. We can think of shorter- term transactions as consumption we might make on an everyday basis.

Beginning May 2020, M1 consists of (1) currency outside the U.S. Treasury, Federal Reserve Banks, and the vaults of depository institutions; (2) demand deposits at commercial banks (excluding those amounts held by depository institutions, the U.S. government, and foreign banks and official institutions) less cash items in the process of collection and Federal Reserve float; and (3) other liquid deposits, consisting of OCDs and savings deposits (including money market deposit accounts). Seasonally adjusted M1 is constructed by summing currency, demand deposits, and OCDs (before May 2020) or other liquid deposits (beginning May 2020), each seasonally adjusted separately. For more information on the H.6 release changes and the regulatory amendment that led to the creation of the other liquid deposits component and its inclusion in the M1 monetary aggregate, see the H.6 announcements (https://www.federalreserve.gov/feeds/h6.html) and Technical Q&As (https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h6/h6_technical_qa.htm) posted on December 17, 2020.

The broader M2 component includes M1 in addition to saving deposits, certificates of deposit (less than $100,000), and money market deposits for individuals. Comparing the velocities of M1 and M2 provides some insight into how quickly the economy is spending and how quickly it is saving.

MZM (money with zero maturity) is the broadest component and consists of the supply of financial assets redeemable at par on demand: notes and coins in circulation, traveler’s checks (non-bank issuers), demand deposits, other checkable deposits, savings deposits, and all money market funds.

875. WEI
   Title: Weekly Economic Index (Lewis-Mertens-Stock)
   Frequency: W
   Popularity: 63
   Notes:
   The WEI is an index of real economic activity using timely and relevant high-frequency data. It represents the common component of ten different daily and weekly series covering consumer behavior, the labor market, and production. The WEI is scaled to the four-quarter GDP growth rate; for example, if the WEI reads -2 percent and the current level of the WEI persists for an entire quarter, one would expect, on average, GDP that quarter to be 2 percent lower than a year previously. 

The WEI is a composite of 10 weekly economic indicators: Redbook same-store sales, Rasmussen Consumer Index, new claims for unemployment insurance, continued claims for unemployment insurance, adjusted income/employment tax withholdings (from Booth Financial Consulting), railroad traffic originated (from the Association of American Railroads), the American Staffing Association Staffing Index, steel production, wholesale sales of gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel, and weekly average US electricity load (with remaining data supplied by Haver Analytics). All series are represented as year-over-year percentage changes. These series are combined into a single index of weekly economic activity.

For additional details, including an analysis of the performance of the model, see Lewis, Mertens, and Stock (2020), “U.S. Economic Activity during the Early Weeks of the SARS-Cov-2 Outbreak.” (https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/staff_reports/sr920)

This index has been developed by Daniel Lewis, an economist in the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Karel Mertens, a senior economic policy advisor at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, and James Stock, the Harold Hitchings Burbank Professor of Political Economy, Faculty of Arts and Sciences of Harvard University.

The index is not an official forecast of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, its president, the Federal Reserve System, or the Federal Open Market Committee.

   Title: M1 (DISCONTINUED)
   Frequency: W
   Popularity: 48
   Notes:
   WM1NS (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/WM1NS), and the seasonally adjusted monthly series is M1SL (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M1SL).

Starting on February 23, 2021, the H.6 statistical release is now published at a monthly frequency and contains only monthly average data needed to construct the monetary aggregates. Weekly average, non-seasonally adjusted data will continue to be made available, while weekly average, seasonally adjusted data will no longer be provided. For further information about the changes to the H.6 statistical release, see the announcements (https://www.federalreserve.gov/feeds/h6.html) provided by the source.

Before May 2020, M1 consists of (1) currency outside the U.S. Treasury, Federal Reserve Banks, and the vaults of depository institutions; (2) demand deposits at commercial banks (excluding those amounts held by depository institutions, the U.S. government, and foreign banks and official institutions) less cash items in the process of collection and Federal Reserve float; and (3) other checkable deposits (OCDs), consisting of negotiable order of withdrawal, or NOW, and automatic transfer service, or ATS, accounts at depository institutions, share draft accounts at credit unions, and demand deposits at thrift institutions.

Beginning May 2020, M1 consists of (1) currency outside the U.S. Treasury, Federal Reserve Banks, and the vaults of depository institutions; (2) demand deposits at commercial banks (excluding those amounts held by depository institutions, the U.S. government, and foreign banks and official institutions) less cash items in the process of collection and Federal Reserve float; and (3) other liquid deposits, consisting of OCDs and savings deposits (including money market deposit accounts). Seasonally adjusted M1 is constructed by summing currency, demand deposits, and OCDs (before May 2020) or other liquid deposits (beginning May 2020), each seasonally adjusted separately.

For more information on the H.6 release changes and the regulatory amendment that led to the creation of the other liquid deposits component and its inclusion in the M1 monetary aggregate, see the H.6 announcements (https://www.federalreserve.gov/feeds/h6.html) and Technical Q&As (https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h6/h6_technical_qa.htm) posted on December 17, 2020.

   Title: Velocity of MZM Money Stock (DISCONTINUED)
   Frequency: Q
   Popularity: 29
   Notes:
   This series has been discontinued and will no longer be updated. The institutional money market funds component (IMFSL (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/IMFSL)) used to calculate MZM has been discontinued by the Board of Governors and is no longer available in the H.6 statistical release, Money Stock Measures. For further information about the changes to the H.6 statistical release, please see the announcements (https://www.federalreserve.gov/feeds/h6.html) provided by the source.

Calculated as the ratio of quarterly nominal GDP (GDP (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GDP)) to the quarterly average of MZM money stock (MZMSL (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MZMSL)).

The velocity of money is the frequency at which one unit of currency is used to purchase domestically- produced goods and services within a given time period. In other words, it is the number of times one dollar is spent to buy goods and services per unit of time. If the velocity of money is increasing, then more transactions are occurring between individuals in an economy.
The frequency of currency exchange can be used to determine the velocity of a given component of the money supply, providing some insight into whether consumers and businesses are saving or spending their money. There are several components of the money supply,: M1, M2, and MZM (M3 is no longer tracked by the Federal Reserve); these components are arranged on a spectrum of narrowest to broadest. Consider M1, the narrowest component. M1 is the money supply of currency in circulation (notes and coins, traveler’s checks [non-bank issuers], demand deposits, and checkable deposits). A decreasing velocity of M1 might indicate fewer short- term consumption transactions are taking place. We can think of shorter- term transactions as consumption we might make on an everyday basis.

The broader M2 component includes M1 in addition to saving deposits, certificates of deposit (less than $100,000), and money market deposits for individuals. Comparing the velocities of M1 and M2 provides some insight into how quickly the economy is spending and how quickly it is saving.

MZM (money with zero maturity) is the broadest component and consists of the supply of financial assets redeemable at par on demand: notes and coins in circulation, traveler’s checks (non-bank issuers), demand deposits, other checkable deposits, savings deposits, and all money market funds. The velocity of MZM helps determine how often financial assets are switching hands within the economy.

   In May of 2016, the source discovered errors in the calculation of the CFSI and began a detailed review of the index and its underlying model. Following that review, the source decided to discontinue the CFSI. https://www.clevelandfed.org/en/our-research/indicators-and-data/cleveland-financial-stress-index.aspx

The source has posted to their website a message regarding this release: Cleveland Financial Stress Index under review and a revised index expected in the fourth quarter of 2016. A thorough review of the index is being conducted to both simplify the index and enhance its robustness, while also taking into consideration changes in financial markets and institutions. This review and the revisions to the CFSI are expected to be completed sometime during the fourth quarter of this year, and additional details will be made available at that time. Thank you for your patience while we improve the CFSI.

This chart shows the contribution of the equity market sector to the CFSI. The contribution to CFSI from the equity market sector includes stock market crashes.

   Title: Disunion Era Bond Prices
   Frequency: W
   Popularity: 9
   Notes:
   The data consists of weekly observations of prices for U.S. 6 percent bonds traded in New York City as reported in the "Notes on the Money Market" section of The Bankers' Magazine and Statistical Register from January 1855 through December 1865. The series may be incomplete due to various limitations in price reporting during the sample period. Available prices were reported for seven-day intervals prior to January 1862 and for ten-day intervals afterwards. The New York Times'summary of daily trading on the New York Stock Exchange was used to complete the series in the best possible manner. The New York Times-reported price that occurred closest to but not beyond the date listed in the Bankers' Magazine was used.

One should not infer the maturity or the issue dates of the bonds from the available prices. The holding period yields or yields to maturity imputed from this data should be interpreted with caution. Such information must be sought from other sources on state finances.

   Popularity: 2
   Notes:
   This Index Was Computed By NBER From Original Data In Thousands Of Pounds Sterling Published In Bankers' Magazine. Additions To Or Subtractions From The Number Of Securities Included Have Been Made From Time To Time. Data From The Old And New Series Were Linked By The NBER And The Resultant Index Is Constructed Based Upon The 1913 Average. At The Points Of These Revisions In The Series The Value For The Given Date According To Both The Old And The New Data Were Available. By Multiplying Data From One Period By A Coefficient Equal To The Ratio Of The Old To The New, A Single Series Was Constructed, Including The Data From Both Original Sections. Consequently, The Various Sections Of Original Data Have Been Tied Together At Their Overlapping Points. July 30, 1914 Was The Day Of Closing For The Exchange. The Stock Exchange Was Closed For The Months Of September-December, 1914. Eight Shares Were Included For The Period 04/1887-12/1895. There Was A Change In The Number Of Securities Included (A Decrease Of One, From Eight To Seven) In 12/1906. In 12/1921, The Number Of Included Securities Increased From 7 To 9. An NBER Note Attributes The Decline In The Index After June, 1916 To Unusual Stock Market Fluctuations, The Abolition Of Minimum Rates, And An Increase In The Bank Rate. There Is No Figure For January, 1916 Because Of The Possibility That The Minimum Would Be Removed Before The End Of The Month. The Estimate For The January, 1915 Prices Is Based On Markings, The Official List, And Where The Securities Are Inactive, The July 27, 1914 Prices. The Valuation For August, 1921 Was Omitted Because Of Stagnation Of The Stock Exchange During The Height Of The Holiday Season.
