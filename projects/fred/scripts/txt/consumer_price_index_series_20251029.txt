1. CPIAUCSL
   Title: Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers: All Items in U.S. City Average
   Frequency: M
   Popularity: 98
   Notes:
   The Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers: All Items (CPIAUCSL) is a price index of a basket of goods and services paid by urban consumers. Percent changes in the price index measure the inflation rate between any two time periods. The most common inflation metric is the percent change from one year ago. It can also represent the buying habits of urban consumers. This particular index includes roughly 88 percent of the total population, accounting for wage earners, clerical workers, technical workers, self-employed, short-term workers, unemployed, retirees, and those not in the labor force.

The CPIs are based on prices for food, clothing, shelter, and fuels; transportation fares; service fees (e.g., water and sewer service); and sales taxes. Prices are collected monthly from about 4,000 housing units and approximately 26,000 retail establishments across 87 urban areas. To calculate the index, price changes are averaged with weights representing their importance in the spending of the particular group. The index measures price changes (as a percent change) from a predetermined reference date. In addition to the original unadjusted index distributed, the Bureau of Labor Statistics also releases a seasonally adjusted index. The unadjusted series reflects all factors that may influence a change in prices. However, it can be very useful to look at the seasonally adjusted CPI, which removes the effects of seasonal changes, such as weather, school year, production cycles, and holidays.

The CPI can be used to recognize periods of inflation and deflation. Significant increases in the CPI within a short time frame might indicate a period of inflation, and significant decreases in CPI within a short time frame might indicate a period of deflation. However, because the CPI includes volatile food and oil prices, it might not be a reliable measure of inflationary and deflationary periods. For a more accurate detection, the core CPI (CPILFESL (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CPILFESL)) is often used. When using the CPI, please note that it is not applicable to all consumers and should not be used to determine relative living costs. Additionally, the CPI is a statistical measure vulnerable to sampling error since it is based on a sample of prices and not the complete average.

For more information on the CPI, see the Handbook of Methods (https://www.bls.gov/opub/hom/cpi/), the release notes and announcements (https://www.bls.gov/cpi/), and the Frequently Asked Questions (https://www.bls.gov/cpi/questions-and-answers.htm) (FAQs).

   Title: Inflation, consumer prices for the United States
   Frequency: A
   Popularity: 87
   Notes:
   Inflation as measured by the consumer price index reflects the annual percentage change in the cost to the average consumer of acquiring a basket of goods and services that may be fixed or changed at specified intervals, such as yearly. The Laspeyres formula is generally used.

   Frequency: M
   Popularity: 84
   Notes:
   The "Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers: All Items Less Food & Energy" is an aggregate of prices paid by urban consumers for a typical basket of goods, excluding food and energy. This measurement, known as "Core CPI," is widely used by economists because food and energy have very volatile prices. The Bureau of Labor Statistics defines and measures the official CPI, and more information can be found in the FAQ (https://www.bls.gov/cpi/questions-and-answers.htm) or in this article (https://www.bls.gov/opub/hom/pdf/cpihom.pdf).

6. PCEPI
   Title: Personal Consumption Expenditures: Chain-type Price Index
   Frequency: M
   Popularity: 83
   Notes:
   BEA Account Code: DPCERG

The Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index is a measure of the prices that people living in the United States, or those buying on their behalf, pay for goods and services. The change in the PCE price index is known for capturing inflation (or deflation) across a wide range of consumer expenses and reflecting changes in consumer behavior. For example, if the price of beef rises, shoppers may buy less beef and more chicken. 

The PCE Price Index is produced by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), which revises previously published PCE data to reflect updated information or new methodology, providing consistency across decades of data that's valuable for researchers. They also offer the series as a Chain-Type index, as above. The PCE price index is used primarily for macroeconomic analysis and forecasting.

The PCE Price index is the Federal Reserve’s preferred measure of inflation. The PCE Price Index is similar to the Bureau of Labor Statistics' consumer price index for urban consumers. The two indexes, which have their own purposes and uses, are constructed differently, resulting in different inflation rates.

   Title: Sticky Price Consumer Price Index less Food and Energy
   Frequency: M
   Popularity: 83
   Notes:
   The Sticky Price Consumer Price Index (CPI) is calculated from a subset of goods and services included in the CPI that change price relatively infrequently. Because these goods and services change price relatively infrequently, they are thought to incorporate expectations about future inflation to a greater degree than prices that change on a more frequent basis. One possible explanation for sticky prices could be the costs firms incur when changing price.

   Title: Median Consumer Price Index
   Frequency: M
   Popularity: 71
   Notes:
   Median Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a measure of core inflation calculated the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland and the Ohio State University. Median CPI was created as a different way to get a 'Core CPI' measure, or a better measure of underlying inflation trends. To calculate the Median CPI, the Cleveland Fed analyzes the median price change of the goods and services published by the BLS. The median price change is the price change that's right in the middle of the long list of all of the price changes. This series excludes 49.5% of the CPI components with the highest and lowest one-month price changes from each tail of the price-change distribution resulting in a Median CPI Inflation Estimate.

According to research from the Cleveland Fed, the Median CPI provides a better signal of the inflation trend than either the all-items CPI or the CPI excluding food and energy. According to newer research done at the Cleveland Fed, the Median CPI is even better at PCE inflation in the near and longer term than the core PCE.

   Title: Sticky Price Consumer Price Index
   Frequency: M
   Popularity: 51
   Notes:
   The Sticky Price Consumer Price Index (CPI) is calculated from a subset of goods and services included in the CPI that change price relatively infrequently. Because these goods and services change price relatively infrequently, they are thought to incorporate expectations about future inflation to a greater degree than prices that change on a more frequent basis. One possible explanation for sticky prices could be the costs firms incur when changing price.

To obtain more information about this release see: Michael F. Bryan, and Brent H. Meyer. “Are Some Prices in the CPI More Forward Looking Than Others? We Think So.” Economic Commentary (Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland) (May 19, 2010): 1–6. https://doi.org/10.26509/frbc-ec-201002 (https://doi.org/10.26509/frbc-ec-201002).

   Title: Sticky Price Consumer Price Index
   Frequency: M

   Notes:
   The Sticky Price Consumer Price Index (CPI) is calculated from a subset of goods and services included in the CPI that change price relatively infrequently. Because these goods and services change price relatively infrequently, they are thought to incorporate expectations about future inflation to a greater degree than prices that change on a more frequent basis. One possible explanation for sticky prices could be the costs firms incur when changing price.

   Title: Sticky Price Consumer Price Index less Food, Energy, and Shelter
   Frequency: M
   Popularity: 44
   Notes:
   The Sticky Price Consumer Price Index (CPI) is calculated from a subset of goods and services included in the CPI that change price relatively infrequently. Because these goods and services change price relatively infrequently, they are thought to incorporate expectations about future inflation to a greater degree than prices that change on a more frequent basis. One possible explanation for sticky prices could be the costs firms incur when changing price.

   The Sticky Price Consumer Price Index (CPI) is calculated from a subset of goods and services included in the CPI that change price relatively infrequently. Because these goods and services change price relatively infrequently, they are thought to incorporate expectations about future inflation to a greater degree than prices that change on a more frequent basis.

   Frequency: M
   Popularity: 31
   Notes:
   16% Trimmed-Mean Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a measure of core inflation calculated by the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland. The Trimmed-Mean CPI excludes the CPI components that show the most extreme monthly price changes. This series excludes 8% of the CPI components with the highest and lowest one-month price changes from each tail of the price-change distribution resulting in a 16% Trimmed-Mean Inflation Estimate.

   Title: Research Consumer Price Index: All Items
   Frequency: M
   Popularity: 35
   Notes:
   The BLS calculates a research price index called the Consumer Price Index for Americans 62 years of age and older, or R-CPI-E. The R-CPI-E is used by those interested in measures of price change specifically based on the spending patterns of the elderly (as defined in the construction of this index). Official uses of the R-CPI-E have been considered by other government agencies but not implemented due to several limitations. These limitations must be considered and understood by potential users of the data, and any conclusions drawn from these analyses should be treated as tentative.

See the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) (https://www.bls.gov/cpi/research-series/r-cpi-e-home.htm) from more information.

   Title: Sticky Price Consumer Price Index less Shelter

   Notes:
   The Sticky Price Consumer Price Index (CPI) is calculated from a subset of goods and services included in the CPI that change price relatively infrequently. Because these goods and services change price relatively infrequently, they are thought to incorporate expectations about future inflation to a greater degree than prices that change on a more frequent basis. One possible explanation for sticky prices could be the costs firms incur when changing price.

   Notes:
   Prior To 1953, This Series Was Called The"Index Of Cost Of Living." Data Have Been Converted To The Average 1957-1959 Base By Bls. Prior To September, 1940, Only Fuel And Food Components Were Monthly, All Other Components Were Priced At Intervals Of 3, 4, And 6 Months (See Survey Of Current Business, May, 1941; Also Monthly Labor Review, August, 1940, And Bls Bulletin Nos. 699 (1941) And 966 (1949) For Detailed Information). The Early Segment Of This Series Represents Monthly Interpolations By The Department Of Commerce. Beginning In 1943, The Index Shows The Results Of A Revision, Begun In 1940, Of The Rent Component (Correction Of New Unit Bias). In January, 1950, A Revision Of Population And Commodity Weights Begins To Be Incorporated In The Index (Monthly Labor Review, March, 1951); Series Is Considered To Be Continuous. A Major Revision Of The Index Took Place In January, 1953; Hereafter Called"Consumer Price Index." Beginning With Indexes For January, 1966, Data For Six Additional Areas (Cincinnati, Houston, Kansas City, Milwaukee, Minneapolis-St. Paul, And San Diego) Have Been Incorporated Into The National Consumer Price Index. These Areas Were"Linked" Into The Consumer Price Index As Of December, 1965 And Were First Used In Calculating The December, 1965-January, 1966 Price Change. Source: Bls Release, "Consumer Price Index--U.S.: All Items, 1913- 1960, Series A; Bcd, February, 1967 For 1961-1965; March, 1968 For 1966-February, 1968.

It is more appropriate to use CPI index values for the particular item categories to measure price change.

Prices, except for electricity, are collected monthly by BLS representatives in the 75 urban areas priced for the CPI. Electricity prices are collected for the BLS for the same 75 areas on a monthly basis by the Department of Energy using mail questionnaires. All fuel prices include applicable Federal, State, and local taxes; prices for natural gas and electricity also include fuel and purchased gas adjustments.

   Frequency: M
   Popularity: 64
   Notes:
   Ground, regular caffeine content coffee sold in a can or plastic container, regardless of size.

Average consumer prices are calculated for household fuel, motor fuel, and food items from prices collected for the Consumer Price Index (CPI). Average prices are best used to measure the price level in a particular month, not to measure price change over time. It is more appropriate to use CPI index values for the particular item categories to measure price change.

Prices, except for electricity, are collected monthly by BLS representatives in the 75 urban areas priced for the CPI. Electricity prices are collected for the BLS for the same 75 areas on a monthly basis by the Department of Energy using mail questionnaires. All fuel prices include applicable Federal, State, and local taxes; prices for natural gas and electricity also include fuel and purchased gas adjustments.

For more information, please visit the Bureau of Labor Statistics (https://www.bls.gov/cpi/factsheets/average-prices.htm).

   Frequency: M
   Popularity: 61
   Notes:
   Steaks other than round or sirloin, regardless of cut or grade. Includes bone-in, boneless, organic, non-organic, fresh, and frozen.

Average consumer prices are calculated for household fuel, motor fuel, and food items from prices collected for the Consumer Price Index (CPI). Average prices are best used to measure the price level in a particular month, not to measure price change over time. It is more appropriate to use CPI index values for the particular item categories to measure price change.

Prices, except for electricity, are collected monthly by BLS representatives in the 75 urban areas priced for the CPI. Electricity prices are collected for the BLS for the same 75 areas on a monthly basis by the Department of Energy using mail questionnaires. All fuel prices include applicable Federal, State, and local taxes; prices for natural gas and electricity also include fuel and purchased gas adjustments.

   Notes:
   Regional price parities (RPPs) are regional price levels expressed as a percentage of the overall national price level for a given year. The price levels are determined by the average prices paid by consumers for the mix of goods and services consumed in each region. Taking the ratio of RPPs shows the difference in price levels across regions.

The term "all items" refers to all the detailed consumption goods and services used in the estimation of the RPPs. 

Nonmetropolitan portion consists of all counties in a state or the US that are outside of metropolitan statistical areas.

   Title: Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices: All Items Excluding Mainly Administered Prices for European Union (28 Countries)
   Frequency: M
   Popularity: 1
   Notes:
   The Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices category "All-Items Excluding Administered Prices (00XAP)" excludes Administered Prices (AP) from the HICP for All-Items.

For a Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICPs) to be included in the Administered Price (AP) category, more than 50% of its underlying items must be either directly set, or heavily influenced by a governmental body or regulator (whether national, regional, or local). There are two types of Administered Prices as defined by Eurostat. Fully Administered Prices (APFULL) includes those that are directly set by the government. Examples include local public transportation charges, education fees, theater tickets, waste collection, childcare, and fees for administrative documents. Mainly Administered Prices (APMAIN) covers the prices of goods and services over which the government or regulator has significant influence. These may include prices that require approval or permission by national regulatory authorities for their change. The influence of the national regulator's decisions could be direct (on retail prices) or indirect (via wholesale prices). However, the regulator must have a significant influence on the consumer price. This index does not provide an exact measure of the development of administered and non-administered prices.

For some European Union Member States, HICPs items considered for inclusion in the administered prices subcategory are supplied by National Statistical Institutes, while with other European Union Member States, these are provided by National Central Banks. Eurostat, the Directorate General for Economic and Financial Affairs, and the European Central Bank verify final classification for all countries.

Examples include local public transportation charges, education fees, theater tickets, waste collection, childcare, and fees for administrative documents. Mainly Administered Prices (APMAIN) covers the prices of goods and services over which the government or regulator has significant influence. These may include prices that require approval or permission by national regulatory authorities for their change. The influence of the national regulator's decisions could be direct (on retail prices) or indirect (via wholesale prices). However, the regulator must have a significant influence on the consumer price. This index does not provide an exact measure of the development of administered and non-administered prices.

For some European Union Member States, HICPs items considered for inclusion in the administered prices subcategory are supplied by National Statistical Institutes, while with other European Union Member States, these are provided by National Central Banks. Eurostat, the Directorate General for Economic and Financial Affairs, and the European Central Bank verify final classification for all countries.

   Notes:
   The Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices category "All-Items Excluding Administered Prices (00XAP)" excludes Administered Prices (AP) from the HICP for All-Items.

For a Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICPs) to be included in the Administered Price (AP) category, more than 50% of its underlying items must be either directly set, or heavily influenced by a governmental body or regulator (whether national, regional, or local). There are two types of Administered Prices as defined by Eurostat. Fully Administered Prices (APFULL) includes those that are directly set by the government. Examples include local public transportation charges, education fees, theater tickets, waste collection, childcare, and fees for administrative documents. Mainly Administered Prices (APMAIN) covers the prices of goods and services over which the government or regulator has significant influence. These may include prices that require approval or permission by national regulatory authorities for their change. The influence of the national regulator's decisions could be direct (on retail prices) or indirect (via wholesale prices). However, the regulator must have a significant influence on the consumer price. This index does not provide an exact measure of the development of administered and non-administered prices.

For some European Union Member States, HICPs items considered for inclusion in the administered prices subcategory are supplied by National Statistical Institutes, while with other European Union Member States, these are provided by National Central Banks. Eurostat, the Directorate General for Economic and Financial Affairs, and the European Central Bank verify final classification for all countries.

   Notes:
   The Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices category "All-Items excluding Mainly Administered Prices (00XAPMAIN)" excludes Mainly Administered Prices (APMAIN) from the HICP for All-Items.

For a Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICPs) to be included in the Administered Price (AP) category, more than 50% of its underlying items must be either directly set, or heavily influenced by a governmental body or regulator (whether national, regional, or local). There are two types of Administered Prices as defined by Eurostat. Fully Administered Prices (APFULL) includes those that are directly set by the government. Examples include local public transportation charges, education fees, theater tickets, waste collection, childcare, and fees for administrative documents. Mainly Administered Prices (APMAIN) covers the prices of goods and services over which the government or regulator has significant influence. These may include prices that require approval or permission by national regulatory authorities for their change. The influence of the national regulator's decisions could be direct (on retail prices) or indirect (via wholesale prices). However, the regulator must have a significant influence on the consumer price. This index does not provide an exact measure of the development of administered and non-administered prices.

For some European Union Member States, HICPs items considered for inclusion in the administered prices subcategory are supplied by National Statistical Institutes, while with other European Union Member States, these are provided by National Central Banks.

   Title: Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices: All Items Excluding Mainly Administered Prices for United Kingdom
   Frequency: M
   Popularity: 1
   Notes:
   The Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices category "All-Items Excluding Administered Prices (00XAP)" excludes Administered Prices (AP) from the HICP for All-Items.

For a Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICPs) to be included in the Administered Price (AP) category, more than 50% of its underlying items must be either directly set, or heavily influenced by a governmental body or regulator (whether national, regional, or local). There are two types of Administered Prices as defined by Eurostat. Fully Administered Prices (APFULL) includes those that are directly set by the government. Examples include local public transportation charges, education fees, theater tickets, waste collection, childcare, and fees for administrative documents. Mainly Administered Prices (APMAIN) covers the prices of goods and services over which the government or regulator has significant influence. These may include prices that require approval or permission by national regulatory authorities for their change. The influence of the national regulator's decisions could be direct (on retail prices) or indirect (via wholesale prices). However, the regulator must have a significant influence on the consumer price. This index does not provide an exact measure of the development of administered and non-administered prices.

For some European Union Member States, HICPs items considered for inclusion in the administered prices subcategory are supplied by National Statistical Institutes, while with other European Union Member States, these are provided by National Central Banks. Eurostat, the Directorate General for Economic and Financial Affairs, and the European Central Bank verify final classification for all countries.

   Notes:
   The Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices category "All-Items Excluding Administered Prices (00XAP)" excludes Administered Prices (AP) from the HICP for All-Items.

For a Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICPs) to be included in the Administered Price (AP) category, more than 50% of its underlying items must be either directly set, or heavily influenced by a governmental body or regulator (whether national, regional, or local). There are two types of Administered Prices as defined by Eurostat. Fully Administered Prices (APFULL) includes those that are directly set by the government. Examples include local public transportation charges, education fees, theater tickets, waste collection, childcare, and fees for administrative documents. Mainly Administered Prices (APMAIN) covers the prices of goods and services over which the government or regulator has significant influence. These may include prices that require approval or permission by national regulatory authorities for their change. The influence of the national regulator's decisions could be direct (on retail prices) or indirect (via wholesale prices). However, the regulator must have a significant influence on the consumer price. This index does not provide an exact measure of the development of administered and non-administered prices.

For some European Union Member States, HICPs items considered for inclusion in the administered prices subcategory are supplied by National Statistical Institutes, while with other European Union Member States, these are provided by National Central Banks.

   Title: Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices: All Items Excluding Mainly Administered Prices for Spain
   Frequency: M
   Popularity: 1
   Notes:
   The Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices category "All-Items Excluding Administered Prices (00XAP)" excludes Administered Prices (AP) from the HICP for All-Items.

For a Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICPs) to be included in the Administered Price (AP) category, more than 50% of its underlying items must be either directly set, or heavily influenced by a governmental body or regulator (whether national, regional, or local). There are two types of Administered Prices as defined by Eurostat. Fully Administered Prices (APFULL) includes those that are directly set by the government. Examples include local public transportation charges, education fees, theater tickets, waste collection, childcare, and fees for administrative documents. Mainly Administered Prices (APMAIN) covers the prices of goods and services over which the government or regulator has significant influence. These may include prices that require approval or permission by national regulatory authorities for their change. The influence of the national regulator's decisions could be direct (on retail prices) or indirect (via wholesale prices). However, the regulator must have a significant influence on the consumer price. This index does not provide an exact measure of the development of administered and non-administered prices.

For some European Union Member States, HICPs items considered for inclusion in the administered prices subcategory are supplied by National Statistical Institutes, while with other European Union Member States, these are provided by National Central Banks. Eurostat, the Directorate General for Economic and Financial Affairs, and the European Central Bank verify final classification for all countries.

For a Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICPs) to be included in the Administered Price (AP) category, more than 50% of its underlying items must be either directly set, or heavily influenced by a governmental body or regulator (whether national, regional, or local). There are two types of Administered Prices as defined by Eurostat. Fully Administered Prices (APFULL) includes those that are directly set by the government. Examples include local public transportation charges, education fees, theater tickets, waste collection, childcare, and fees for administrative documents. Mainly Administered Prices (APMAIN) covers the prices of goods and services over which the government or regulator has significant influence. These may include prices that require approval or permission by national regulatory authorities for their change. The influence of the national regulator's decisions could be direct (on retail prices) or indirect (via wholesale prices). However, the regulator must have a significant influence on the consumer price. This index does not provide an exact measure of the development of administered and non-administered prices.

For some European Union Member States, HICPs items considered for inclusion in the administered prices subcategory are supplied by National Statistical Institutes, while with other European Union Member States, these are provided by National Central Banks. Eurostat, the Directorate General for Economic and Financial Affairs, and the European Central Bank verify final classification for all countries.

   Notes:
   The Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices category "All-Items Excluding Administered Prices (00XAP)" excludes Administered Prices (AP) from the HICP for All-Items.

For a Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICPs) to be included in the Administered Price (AP) category, more than 50% of its underlying items must be either directly set, or heavily influenced by a governmental body or regulator (whether national, regional, or local). There are two types of Administered Prices as defined by Eurostat. Fully Administered Prices (APFULL) includes those that are directly set by the government. Examples include local public transportation charges, education fees, theater tickets, waste collection, childcare, and fees for administrative documents. Mainly Administered Prices (APMAIN) covers the prices of goods and services over which the government or regulator has significant influence. These may include prices that require approval or permission by national regulatory authorities for their change. The influence of the national regulator's decisions could be direct (on retail prices) or indirect (via wholesale prices). However, the regulator must have a significant influence on the consumer price. This index does not provide an exact measure of the development of administered and non-administered prices.

For some European Union Member States, HICPs items considered for inclusion in the administered prices subcategory are supplied by National Statistical Institutes, while with other European Union Member States, these are provided by National Central Banks.

   Notes:
   The Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices category "All-Items Excluding Administered Prices (00XAP)" excludes Administered Prices (AP) from the HICP for All-Items.

For a Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICPs) to be included in the Administered Price (AP) category, more than 50% of its underlying items must be either directly set, or heavily influenced by a governmental body or regulator (whether national, regional, or local). There are two types of Administered Prices as defined by Eurostat. Fully Administered Prices (APFULL) includes those that are directly set by the government. Examples include local public transportation charges, education fees, theater tickets, waste collection, childcare, and fees for administrative documents. Mainly Administered Prices (APMAIN) covers the prices of goods and services over which the government or regulator has significant influence. These may include prices that require approval or permission by national regulatory authorities for their change. The influence of the national regulator's decisions could be direct (on retail prices) or indirect (via wholesale prices). However, the regulator must have a significant influence on the consumer price. This index does not provide an exact measure of the development of administered and non-administered prices.

For some European Union Member States, HICPs items considered for inclusion in the administered prices subcategory are supplied by National Statistical Institutes, while with other European Union Member States, these are provided by National Central Banks. Eurostat, the Directorate General for Economic and Financial Affairs, and the European Central Bank verify final classification for all countries.

   Popularity: 1
   Notes:
   The Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices category "All-Items excluding Fully Administered Prices (00XAPFULL)" excludes Fully Administered Prices (APFULL) from the HICP for All-Items.

For a Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICPs) to be included in the Administered Price (AP) category, more than 50% of its underlying items must be either directly set, or heavily influenced by a governmental body or regulator (whether national, regional, or local). There are two types of Administered Prices as defined by Eurostat. Fully Administered Prices (APFULL) includes those that are directly set by the government. Examples include local public transportation charges, education fees, theater tickets, waste collection, childcare, and fees for administrative documents. Mainly Administered Prices (APMAIN) covers the prices of goods and services over which the government or regulator has significant influence. These may include prices that require approval or permission by national regulatory authorities for their change. The influence of the national regulator's decisions could be direct (on retail prices) or indirect (via wholesale prices). However, the regulator must have a significant influence on the consumer price. This index does not provide an exact measure of the development of administered and non-administered prices.

For some European Union Member States, HICPs items considered for inclusion in the administered prices subcategory are supplied by National Statistical Institutes, while with other European Union Member States, these are provided by National Central Banks. Eurostat, the Directorate General for Economic and Financial Affairs, and the European Central Bank verify final classification for all countries.

   Title: Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices: All Items Excluding Fully Administered Prices for Greece

   Popularity: 1
   Notes:
   The Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices category "All-Items excluding Fully Administered Prices (00XAPFULL)" excludes Fully Administered Prices (APFULL) from the HICP for All-Items.

For a Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICPs) to be included in the Administered Price (AP) category, more than 50% of its underlying items must be either directly set, or heavily influenced by a governmental body or regulator (whether national, regional, or local). There are two types of Administered Prices as defined by Eurostat. Fully Administered Prices (APFULL) includes those that are directly set by the government. Examples include local public transportation charges, education fees, theater tickets, waste collection, childcare, and fees for administrative documents. Mainly Administered Prices (APMAIN) covers the prices of goods and services over which the government or regulator has significant influence. These may include prices that require approval or permission by national regulatory authorities for their change. The influence of the national regulator's decisions could be direct (on retail prices) or indirect (via wholesale prices). However, the regulator must have a significant influence on the consumer price. This index does not provide an exact measure of the development of administered and non-administered prices.

For some European Union Member States, HICPs items considered for inclusion in the administered prices subcategory are supplied by National Statistical Institutes, while with other European Union Member States, these are provided by National Central Banks.

   Title: Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices: All Items Excluding Fully Administered Prices for Netherlands
   Frequency: M
   Popularity: 1
   Notes:
   The Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices category "All-Items excluding Fully Administered Prices (00XAPFULL)" excludes Fully Administered Prices (APFULL) from the HICP for All-Items.

For a Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICPs) to be included in the Administered Price (AP) category, more than 50% of its underlying items must be either directly set, or heavily influenced by a governmental body or regulator (whether national, regional, or local). There are two types of Administered Prices as defined by Eurostat. Fully Administered Prices (APFULL) includes those that are directly set by the government. Examples include local public transportation charges, education fees, theater tickets, waste collection, childcare, and fees for administrative documents. Mainly Administered Prices (APMAIN) covers the prices of goods and services over which the government or regulator has significant influence. These may include prices that require approval or permission by national regulatory authorities for their change. The influence of the national regulator's decisions could be direct (on retail prices) or indirect (via wholesale prices). However, the regulator must have a significant influence on the consumer price. This index does not provide an exact measure of the development of administered and non-administered prices.

For some European Union Member States, HICPs items considered for inclusion in the administered prices subcategory are supplied by National Statistical Institutes, while with other European Union Member States, these are provided by National Central Banks. Eurostat, the Directorate General for Economic and Financial Affairs, and the European Central Bank verify final classification for all countries.

   Notes:
   The Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices category "All-Items excluding Fully Administered Prices (00XAPFULL)" excludes Fully Administered Prices (APFULL) from the HICP for All-Items.

For a Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICPs) to be included in the Administered Price (AP) category, more than 50% of its underlying items must be either directly set, or heavily influenced by a governmental body or regulator (whether national, regional, or local). There are two types of Administered Prices as defined by Eurostat. Fully Administered Prices (APFULL) includes those that are directly set by the government. Examples include local public transportation charges, education fees, theater tickets, waste collection, childcare, and fees for administrative documents. Mainly Administered Prices (APMAIN) covers the prices of goods and services over which the government or regulator has significant influence. These may include prices that require approval or permission by national regulatory authorities for their change. The influence of the national regulator's decisions could be direct (on retail prices) or indirect (via wholesale prices). However, the regulator must have a significant influence on the consumer price. This index does not provide an exact measure of the development of administered and non-administered prices.

For some European Union Member States, HICPs items considered for inclusion in the administered prices subcategory are supplied by National Statistical Institutes, while with other European Union Member States, these are provided by National Central Banks. Eurostat, the Directorate General for Economic and Financial Affairs, and the European Central Bank verify final classification for all countries.

   Title: Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices: All Items Excluding Fully Administered Prices for European Union (27 Countries from 2020)
   Frequency: M
   Popularity: 1
   Notes:
   The Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices category All-Items excluding Fully Administered Prices (00XAPFULL) excludes Fully Administered Prices (APFULL) from the HICP for All-Items.

For a Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICPs) to be included in the Administered Price (AP) category, more than 50% of its underlying items must be either directly set, or heavily influenced by a governmental body or regulator (whether national, regional, or local). There are two types of Administered Prices as defined by Eurostat. Fully Administered Prices (APFULL) includes those that are directly set by the government. Examples include local public transportation charges, education fees, theater tickets, waste collection, childcare, and fees for administrative documents. Mainly Administered Prices (APMAIN) covers the prices of goods and services over which the government or regulator has significant influence. These may include prices that require approval or permission by national regulatory authorities for their change. The influence of the national regulator's decisions could be direct (on retail prices) or indirect (via wholesale prices). However, the regulator must have a significant influence on the consumer price. This index does not provide an exact measure of the development of administered and non-administered prices.

For some European Union Member States, HICPs items considered for inclusion in the administered prices subcategory are supplied by National Statistical Institutes, while with other European Union Member States, these are provided by National Central Banks. Eurostat, the Directorate General for Economic and Financial Affairs, and the European Central Bank verify final classification for all countries.

   Notes:
   The Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices category "All-Items excluding Fully Administered Prices (00XAPFULL)" excludes Fully Administered Prices (APFULL) from the HICP for All-Items.

For a Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICPs) to be included in the Administered Price (AP) category, more than 50% of its underlying items must be either directly set, or heavily influenced by a governmental body or regulator (whether national, regional, or local). There are two types of Administered Prices as defined by Eurostat. Fully Administered Prices (APFULL) includes those that are directly set by the government. Examples include local public transportation charges, education fees, theater tickets, waste collection, childcare, and fees for administrative documents. Mainly Administered Prices (APMAIN) covers the prices of goods and services over which the government or regulator has significant influence. These may include prices that require approval or permission by national regulatory authorities for their change. The influence of the national regulator's decisions could be direct (on retail prices) or indirect (via wholesale prices). However, the regulator must have a significant influence on the consumer price. This index does not provide an exact measure of the development of administered and non-administered prices.

   Title: Output of Construction Materials for Domestic Consumption Value in Constant Prices for United States
   Frequency: A
   Popularity: 1
   Notes:
   Data Represent Total Output Of Construction Materials, Less Exports And Plus Imports. Construction Materials Include (1) Nonmanufactured Commodities, Such As Lumber (Destined For Direct Use In Construction), Cross Ties, Sand And Gravel, And Crushed Stone; And (2) Manufactured Products, Such As Lumber Products, Cement, Brick, Rails, Structural Ironwork, Etc. (For Complete List Of Manufactured Products, See Source, Pp. 133-135) These Covered Commodities Include Some Which Were Classified Directly As Construction Materials, And Another Group Of "Mixed Commodities," Such As Lumber, Wrought Pipe, And Statuary And Art Goods, For Which The Proportion Allotable To Construction Materials Was Estimated. Value Estimates Exclude Costs After Production, Such As Transportation And Distribution Costs. For The Period 1869-1919, Output, Exports, And Imports Were Estimated As Follows. Estimates Of The Value Of Output Are Based Primarily On The"Census Of Manufactures", Decennially, 1869-1899, And Quinquennially, 1899- 1919. Intercensal Estimates Were Developed From State Statistical Reports For Seven States (See Source, Pp. 232-233), Figures From Governmental Agencies Such As The Bureau Of Mines, And The Department Of Agriculture, And From Trade Associations Such As The American Iron And Steel Institute (See Source, Pp. 241-242). Exports Were Compiled From Detailed Statistics In The December Issues Of The"Monthly Summary Of Foreign Commerce" For 1893-1919. For 1869, And 1889-1893, Calendar-Year Totals Were Derived From The"Quarterly Report Of The Chief Of The Bureau Of Statistics", U.S.Treasury Department. These Basic Export Statistics Were Modified As To Classification Of Commodities, And Were Adjusted To Price Levels Comparable With The Output Data (Manufacturers' Or Producers' Prices). Imports For Consumption, Including Duties, Were Obtained From Fiscal- Year Data In"Foreign Commerce And Navigation", And Were Adjusted To A Calendar- Year Basis. For The Period 1919-33, The Data Are Based On Kuznets' Estimates ("Commodity Flow And Capital Formation", I, New York, NBER, 1938), Adjusted To Improve Comparability With Earlier Years. Ratios Of Kuznets' Unadjusted Value Of Domestic Consumption To His Unadjusted Value Of Domestic Output Were Computed For 1919 And 1929 And Interpolated For Intervening Years. These Ratios Were Applied To Kuznets' Adjusted Output Values. After 1933 The Estimates Are Rough Extrapolations. Values In 1913 Prices Were Derived By Applying Price Indexes To The Current Price Series. For 1914-39, Bureau Of Labor Statistics Indexes For Lumber And Building Materials And For Steel Rails Were Combined, Using 1926 Weights. For 1890-1913, A Similar Composite, Using 1909 Weights, Was Combined With An Index Of Structural Steel Prices, Computed From"Metal Statistics", 1938. For Years Before 1890, Series On Eleven Commodities Were Combined, Using 1909 Bls Weights, And The Resulting Index Was Linked To The Series For Later Years. See Lipsey And Preston, Pp. 284-285. Source: William Howard Shaw, "Value Of Commodity Output Since 1869", Pp. 64-65, 69, 76-77. In Addition To The Annual Data Beginning In 1889, Estimates Are Given In The Source For 1889 And 1879 As Follows: 1869 ($ Million), Current Dollars, 377.4; 1913 Dollars, 351.4; 1879 ($ Million), Current Dollars, 444.2; 1913 Dollars, 545.7.
