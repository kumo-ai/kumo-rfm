   Title: Sticky Price Consumer Price Index less Food and Energy
   Frequency: M
   Popularity: 83
   Notes:
   The Sticky Price Consumer Price Index (CPI) is calculated from a subset of goods and services included in the CPI that change price relatively infrequently. Because these goods and services change price relatively infrequently, they are thought to incorporate expectations about future inflation to a greater degree than prices that change on a more frequent basis. One possible explanation for sticky prices could be the costs firms incur when changing price.

   Title: Average Price: Electricity per Kilowatt-Hour in U.S. City Average
   Frequency: M
   Popularity: 77
   Notes:
   All electricity.

Average consumer prices are calculated for household fuel, motor fuel, and food items from prices collected for the Consumer Price Index (CPI). Average prices are best used to measure the price level in a particular month, not to measure price change over time. It is more appropriate to use CPI index values for the particular item categories to measure price change.

Prices, except for electricity, are collected monthly by BLS representatives in the 75 urban areas priced for the CPI. Electricity prices are collected for the BLS for the same 75 areas on a monthly basis by the Department of Energy using mail questionnaires. All fuel prices include applicable Federal, State, and local taxes; prices for natural gas and electricity also include fuel and purchased gas adjustments.

   Title: Personal Consumption Expenditures Excluding Food and Energy (Chain-Type Price Index)
   Frequency: M
   Popularity: 75
   Notes:
   BEA Account Code: DPCCRG

The Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index is a measure of the prices that people living in the United States, or those buying on their behalf, pay for goods and services. The change in the PCE price index is known for capturing inflation (or deflation) across a wide range of consumer expenses and reflecting changes in consumer behavior. For example, if car prices rise, car sales may decline while bicycle sales increase. 

The PCE Price Index is produced by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), which revises previously published PCE data to reflect updated information or new methodology, providing consistency across decades of data that's valuable for researchers. They also offer the series as a Chain-Type index and excluding food and energy products, as above. The PCE price index less food excluding food and energy is used primarily for macroeconomic analysis and forecasting future values of the PCE price index.

The PCE Price Index is similar to the Bureau of Labor Statistics' consumer price index for urban consumers. The two indexes, which have their own purposes and uses, are constructed differently, resulting in different inflation rates.

For more information on the PCE price index, see:

   Notes:
   The “Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers: All Items Less Food & Energy” is an aggregate of prices paid by urban consumers for a typical basket of goods, excluding food and energy. This measurement, known as “Core CPI,” is widely used by economists because food and energy have very volatile prices. The Bureau of Labor Statistics defines and measures the official CPI, and more information can be found here: https://www.bls.gov/cpi/questions-and-answers.htm or here: https://www.bls.gov/opub/hom/pdf/cpihom.pdf.

   Title: Flexible Price Consumer Price Index less Food and Energy
   Frequency: M
   Popularity: 19
   Notes:
   The Flexible Price Consumer Price Index (CPI) is calculated from a subset of goods and services included in the CPI that change price relatively frequently. Because flexible prices are quick to change, it assumes that when these prices are set, they incorporate less of an expectation about future inflation. Evidence suggests that this flexible price measure is more responsive to changes in the current economic environment or the level of economic slack.

   Title: Average Price: Automotive Diesel Fuel (Cost per Gallon/3.785 Liters) in U.S. City Average
   Frequency: M
   Popularity: 21
   Notes:
   All automotive diesel fuel.

Average consumer prices are calculated for household fuel, motor fuel, and food items from prices collected for the Consumer Price Index (CPI). Average prices are best used to measure the price level in a particular month, not to measure price change over time. It is more appropriate to use CPI index values for the particular item categories to measure price change.

Prices, except for electricity, are collected monthly by BLS representatives in the 75 urban areas priced for the CPI. Electricity prices are collected for the BLS for the same 75 areas on a monthly basis by the Department of Energy using mail questionnaires. All fuel prices include applicable Federal, State, and local taxes; prices for natural gas and electricity also include fuel and purchased gas adjustments.

For more information, please visit the Bureau of Labor Statistics (https://www.bls.gov/cpi/factsheets/average-prices.htm).

   Title: Average Price: Electricity per Kilowatt-Hour in Phoenix-Mesa-Scottsdale, AZ (CBSA)
   Frequency: M
   Popularity: 21
   Notes:
   All electricity.

Average consumer prices are calculated for household fuel, motor fuel, and food items from prices collected for the Consumer Price Index (CPI). Average prices are best used to measure the price level in a particular month, not to measure price change over time. It is more appropriate to use CPI index values for the particular item categories to measure price change.

Prices, except for electricity, are collected monthly by BLS representatives in the 75 urban areas priced for the CPI. Electricity prices are collected for the BLS for the same 75 areas on a monthly basis by the Department of Energy using mail questionnaires. All fuel prices include applicable Federal, State, and local taxes; prices for natural gas and electricity also include fuel and purchased gas adjustments.

   Title: Average Price: Electricity per Kilowatt-Hour in the Midwest Census Region - Urban
   Frequency: M
   Popularity: 9
   Notes:
   All electricity.

Average consumer prices are calculated for household fuel, motor fuel, and food items from prices collected for the Consumer Price Index (CPI). Average prices are best used to measure the price level in a particular month, not to measure price change over time. It is more appropriate to use CPI index values for the particular item categories to measure price change.

Prices, except for electricity, are collected monthly by BLS representatives in the 75 urban areas priced for the CPI. Electricity prices are collected for the BLS for the same 75 areas on a monthly basis by the Department of Energy using mail questionnaires. All fuel prices include applicable Federal, State, and local taxes; prices for natural gas and electricity also include fuel and purchased gas adjustments.

For more information, please visit the Bureau of Labor Statistics (https://www.bls.gov/cpi/factsheets/average-prices.htm).

   Title: Average Price: Electricity per Kilowatt-Hour in the Northeast Census Region - Urban
   Frequency: M
   Popularity: 8
   Notes:
   All electricity.

Average consumer prices are calculated for household fuel, motor fuel, and food items from prices collected for the Consumer Price Index (CPI). Average prices are best used to measure the price level in a particular month, not to measure price change over time. It is more appropriate to use CPI index values for the particular item categories to measure price change.

Prices, except for electricity, are collected monthly by BLS representatives in the 75 urban areas priced for the CPI. Electricity prices are collected for the BLS for the same 75 areas on a monthly basis by the Department of Energy using mail questionnaires. All fuel prices include applicable Federal, State, and local taxes; prices for natural gas and electricity also include fuel and purchased gas adjustments.

For more information, please visit the Bureau of Labor Statistics (https://www.bls.gov/cpi/factsheets/average-prices.htm).

   Frequency: M
   Popularity: 87
   Notes:
   Large white, Grade A chicken eggs, sold in a carton of a dozen. Includes organic, non-organic, cage free, free range, and traditional.

Average consumer prices are calculated for household fuel, motor fuel, and food items from prices collected for the Consumer Price Index (CPI). Average prices are best used to measure the price level in a particular month, not to measure price change over time. It is more appropriate to use CPI index values for the particular item categories to measure price change.

Prices, except for electricity, are collected monthly by BLS representatives in the 75 urban areas priced for the CPI. Electricity prices are collected for the BLS for the same 75 areas on a monthly basis by the Department of Energy using mail questionnaires. All fuel prices include applicable Federal, State, and local taxes; prices for natural gas and electricity also include fuel and purchased gas adjustments.

   Title: Producer Price Index by Commodity for Finished Goods Less Food and Energy (DISCONTINUED)
   Frequency: M
   Popularity: 15
   Notes:
   In January 2014, the Producer Price Index (PPI) transitioned from the Stage of Processing (SOP) aggregation system to the Final Demand-Intermediate Demand (FD-ID) aggregation system. Effective with the January 2016 Producer Price Index (PPI) data release in February 2016, PPI ceased the calculation and publication of the Stage of Processing (SOP) versions of these indexes. Going forward, data users wishing to track prices for finished goods, processed goods for intermediate demand (intermediate goods), unprocessed goods for intermediate demand (crude goods), or any of the former SOP-based component indexes will need to use the corresponding index codes from the Final Demand-Intermediate Demand (FD-ID) aggregation system. The FD-ID aggregation system webpage provides a table listing the SOP indexes and their concordant FD-ID indexes. https://www.bls.gov/ppi/fdidconcordance.htm

The data series has transitioned from the Stage of Processing (SOP) aggregation system to the Final Demand-Intermediate Demand (FD-ID). All Stage of Processing (SOP) data series have been discontinued. Please see the replacement for the data series at: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/WPSFD4131

   Title: Average Price: Electricity per 500 Kilowatt-Hour in U.S. City Average
   Frequency: M
   Popularity: 6
   Notes:
   Average consumer prices are calculated for household fuel, motor fuel, and food items from prices collected for the Consumer Price Index (CPI). Average prices are best used to measure the price level in a particular month, not to measure price change over time. It is more appropriate to use CPI index values for the particular item categories to measure price change.

Prices, except for electricity, are collected monthly by BLS representatives in the 75 urban areas priced for the CPI. Electricity prices are collected for the BLS for the same 75 areas on a monthly basis by the Department of Energy using mail questionnaires. All fuel prices include applicable Federal, State, and local taxes; prices for natural gas and electricity also include fuel and purchased gas adjustments.

For more information, please visit the Bureau of Labor Statistics (https://www.bls.gov/cpi/factsheets/average-prices.htm).

   Title: Average Price: Electricity per Kilowatt-Hour in Baltimore-Columbia-Towson, MD (CBSA)
   Frequency: M
   Popularity: 10
   Notes:
   All electricity.

Average consumer prices are calculated for household fuel, motor fuel, and food items from prices collected for the Consumer Price Index (CPI). Average prices are best used to measure the price level in a particular month, not to measure price change over time. It is more appropriate to use CPI index values for the particular item categories to measure price change.

Prices, except for electricity, are collected monthly by BLS representatives in the 75 urban areas priced for the CPI. Electricity prices are collected for the BLS for the same 75 areas on a monthly basis by the Department of Energy using mail questionnaires. All fuel prices include applicable Federal, State, and local taxes; prices for natural gas and electricity also include fuel and purchased gas adjustments.

For more information, please visit the Bureau of Labor Statistics (https://www.bls.gov/cpi/factsheets/average-prices.htm).

   Notes:
   In January 2014, the Producer Price Index (PPI) transitioned from the Stage of Processing (SOP) aggregation system to the Final Demand-Intermediate Demand (FD-ID) aggregation system. Effective with the January 2016 Producer Price Index (PPI) data release in February 2016, PPI ceased the calculation and publication of the Stage of Processing (SOP) versions of these indexes. Going forward, data users wishing to track prices for finished goods, processed goods for intermediate demand (intermediate goods), unprocessed goods for intermediate demand (crude goods), or any of the former SOP-based component indexes will need to use the corresponding index codes from the Final Demand-Intermediate Demand (FD-ID) aggregation system. The FD-ID aggregation system webpage provides a table listing the SOP indexes and their concordant FD-ID indexes. https://www.bls.gov/ppi/fdidconcordance.htm

The data series has transitioned from the Stage of Processing (SOP) aggregation system to the Final Demand-Intermediate Demand (FD-ID). All Stage of Processing (SOP) data series have been discontinued. Please see the replacement for the data series at: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/WPSFD49208

   Title: Average Price: Electricity per Kilowatt-Hour in Size Class A
   Frequency: M
   Popularity: 4
   Notes:
   All electricity.

Average consumer prices are calculated for household fuel, motor fuel, and food items from prices collected for the Consumer Price Index (CPI). Average prices are best used to measure the price level in a particular month, not to measure price change over time. It is more appropriate to use CPI index values for the particular item categories to measure price change.

Prices, except for electricity, are collected monthly by BLS representatives in the 75 urban areas priced for the CPI. Electricity prices are collected for the BLS for the same 75 areas on a monthly basis by the Department of Energy using mail questionnaires. All fuel prices include applicable Federal, State, and local taxes; prices for natural gas and electricity also include fuel and purchased gas adjustments.

Average consumer prices are calculated for household fuel, motor fuel, and food items from prices collected for the Consumer Price Index (CPI). Average prices are best used to measure the price level in a particular month, not to measure price change over time. It is more appropriate to use CPI index values for the particular item categories to measure price change.

Prices, except for electricity, are collected monthly by BLS representatives in the 75 urban areas priced for the CPI. Electricity prices are collected for the BLS for the same 75 areas on a monthly basis by the Department of Energy using mail questionnaires. All fuel prices include applicable Federal, State, and local taxes; prices for natural gas and electricity also include fuel and purchased gas adjustments.

For more information, please visit the Bureau of Labor Statistics (https://www.bls.gov/cpi/factsheets/average-prices.htm).

   Popularity: 1
   Notes:
   In January 2014, the Producer Price Index (PPI) transitioned from the Stage of Processing (SOP) aggregation system to the Final Demand-Intermediate Demand (FD-ID) aggregation system. Effective with the January 2016 Producer Price Index (PPI) data release in February 2016, PPI ceased the calculation and publication of the Stage of Processing (SOP) versions of these indexes. Going forward, data users wishing to track prices for finished goods, processed goods for intermediate demand (intermediate goods), unprocessed goods for intermediate demand (crude goods), or any of the former SOP-based component indexes will need to use the corresponding index codes from the Final Demand-Intermediate Demand (FD-ID) aggregation system. The FD-ID aggregation system webpage provides a table listing the SOP indexes and their concordant FD-ID indexes. https://www.bls.gov/ppi/fdidconcordance.htm

The data series has transitioned from the Stage of Processing (SOP) aggregation system to the Final Demand-Intermediate Demand (FD-ID). All Stage of Processing (SOP) data series have been discontinued. Please see the replacement for the data series at: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/WPUID69212

   Notes:
   In January 2014, the Producer Price Index (PPI) transitioned from the Stage of Processing (SOP) aggregation system to the Final Demand-Intermediate Demand (FD-ID) aggregation system. Effective with the January 2016 Producer Price Index (PPI) data release in February 2016, PPI ceased the calculation and publication of the Stage of Processing (SOP) versions of these indexes. Going forward, data users wishing to track prices for finished goods, processed goods for intermediate demand (intermediate goods), unprocessed goods for intermediate demand (crude goods), or any of the former SOP-based component indexes will need to use the corresponding index codes from the Final Demand-Intermediate Demand (FD-ID) aggregation system. The FD-ID aggregation system webpage provides a table listing the SOP indexes and their concordant FD-ID indexes. https://www.bls.gov/ppi/fdidconcordance.htm

The data series has transitioned from the Stage of Processing (SOP) aggregation system to the Final Demand-Intermediate Demand (FD-ID). All Stage of Processing (SOP) data series have been discontinued. Please see the replacement for the data series at: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/WPSID69113

   Notes:
   In January 2014, the Producer Price Index (PPI) transitioned from the Stage of Processing (SOP) aggregation system to the Final Demand-Intermediate Demand (FD-ID) aggregation system. Effective with the January 2016 Producer Price Index (PPI) data release in February 2016, PPI ceased the calculation and publication of the Stage of Processing (SOP) versions of these indexes. Going forward, data users wishing to track prices for finished goods, processed goods for intermediate demand (intermediate goods), unprocessed goods for intermediate demand (crude goods), or any of the former SOP-based component indexes will need to use the corresponding index codes from the Final Demand-Intermediate Demand (FD-ID) aggregation system. The FD-ID aggregation system webpage provides a table listing the SOP indexes and their concordant FD-ID indexes. https://www.bls.gov/ppi/fdidconcordance.htm

The data series has transitioned from the Stage of Processing (SOP) aggregation system to the Final Demand-Intermediate Demand (FD-ID). All Stage of Processing (SOP) data series have been discontinued. Please see the replacement for the data series at: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/WPSFD4121
