13. GGNLBAUSA188N
   Title: General government net lending/borrowing for United States
   Frequency: A
   Popularity: 26
   Notes:
   Net lending (+)/ borrowing (-) is calculated as revenue minus total expenditure. This is a core Government Finance Statistics (GFS) balance that measures the extent to which general government is either putting financial resources at the disposal of other sectors in the economy and nonresidents (net lending), or utilizing the financial resources generated by other sectors and nonresidents (net borrowing). This balance may be viewed as an indicator of the financial impact of general government activity on the rest of the economy and nonresidents (Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001 (GFSM 2001), paragraph 4.17). Note: Net lending (+)/borrowing (-) is also equal to net acquisition of financial assets minus net incurrence of liabilities. A projection of this data can be found at https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GGNLBPUSA188N.

In February 1954, The Daily Treasury Statement Discontinued Reporting Expenditures. The New Monthly Report Issued By The Treasury Department Was Based On Reports From Collecting And Disbursing Agencies And Is Considered More Accurate By The Treasury Because It Allows"The Necessary Time For Uniform Reporting Of Budget Results" (Daily Statement, February 17, 1954). Beginning In July 1960, "Net" Budget Receipts (And "Net" Budget Expenditures) Exclude Certain Interfund Transactions Which Are Included In Both Budget Receipts And Budget Expenditures. The Transactions Deducted Are Mainly Interest Payments To The Treasury By Government Corporations And Agencies. This Does Not Affect Budget Surplus Or Deficit. The Worksheets For This Variable Show The Old "Net" Figures, After June 1960 Called "Subtotal Receipts." It Is Believed That The Data Can Be Treated As A Continuous Series Since Deductions Are Very Small. From January 1962 On, Refunds Include Amounts Applicable To Trust Accounts Formerly Included In "Transfers To Trust Accounts", One Of The Items Deducted From Receipts To Derive "Net" Receipts. Refunds Applicable To Trust Accounts Have Here Been Eliminated And The Amounts Of Refunds Added Back Into Net Budget Receipts Are Comparable Throughout.

   Notes:
   Series Is Presented Here As Three Variables--(1)--Original Data, 1879-1933 (2)--Original Data, 1930-1940 (3)--Original Data, 1939-1962. The Raw Figure For July 1948 Excludes Inter-Agency Transactions -- Repayment Of Capital Stock To The Treasury By The Reconstruction Finance Commission Amounting To $225 Million, And The Transfer Of Earnings To The Treasury By The Federal Farm Mortgage Corporation Amounting To $40 Million. The Corresponding Expenditure Figure Is $3698.4 Million. In February 1954 The Daily Treasury Statement Discontinued Reporting Receipts. The New Monthly Report Issued By The Treasury Department Was Based On Reports From Collecting And Distributing Agencies. It Is Considered More Accurate By The Treasury Because It Allows "The Necessary Time For Uniform Reporting Of Budget Results" (Daily Statement, February 17, 1954). The Figure For January 1954 On The Old Basis (Daily Statement) Is 40,535.2. Beginning In July 1960, "Net" Budget Receipts (And "Net" Budget Expenditures) Exclude Certain Interfund Transactions Which Are Included In Both Budget Receipts And Budget Expenditures. The Transactions Deducted Are Mainly Interest Payments To The Treasury By Government Corporations And Agencies. This Does Not Affect Budget Surplus Or Deficit. The Worksheets For This Variable Show The Old "Net" Figures, After June 1960 Called "Subtotal Receipts." It Is Believed That The Data Can Be Treated As A Continuous Series Since Deductions Are Very Small. From January 1962 On, Refunds Include Amounts Applicable To Trust Accounts Formerly Included In "Transfers To Trust Accounts", One Of The Items Deducted From Receipts To Derive "Net" Receipts. Refunds Applicable To Trust Accounts Have Here Been Eliminated And The Amounts Of Refunds Added Back Into Net Budget Receipts Are Comparable Throughout.

   Title: General government net lending/borrowing for Russia
   Frequency: A
   Popularity: 6
   Notes:
   Net lending (+)/ borrowing (-) is calculated as revenue minus total expenditure. This is a core Government Finance Statistics (GFS) balance that measures the extent to which general government is either putting financial resources at the disposal of other sectors in the economy and nonresidents (net lending), or utilizing the financial resources generated by other sectors and nonresidents (net borrowing). This balance may be viewed as an indicator of the financial impact of general government activity on the rest of the economy and nonresidents (Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001 (GFSM 2001), paragraph 4.17). Note: Net lending (+)/borrowing (-) is also equal to net acquisition of financial assets minus net incurrence of liabilities. A projection of this data can be found at https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GGNLBPRUA188N.

   Title: CredAbility Consumer Distress Index for Household Budget (DISCONTINUED)
   Frequency: Q
   Popularity: 4
   Notes:
   Overview of the Index
The Index is a quarterly comprehensive picture of the average American household’s financial condition. Built by assessing the key elements of financial health and distress, it converts a complex set of factors into a single, easy to understand number.

Scope and History
The index measures the U.S., all 50 states and more than 70 MSAs. The national and state versions date back to 1980 and the MSA versions date back to 1990.

Public Data and Proprietary Methodology
We use more than 65 data points from government, public and private data and a proprietary methodology for compiling, combining and evaluating data. With nearly 50 years of experience and insight into helping consumers in financial distress, we know the biggest causes of distress, how people react to financial challenges and proven strategies for regaining control. (Note: Our client data is not a data source for the Index)

Measured on a 100 Point Scale
Financial distress is measured on a 100 point scale and a score under 70 indicates financial distress. The lower the score equals more distress, a weaker financial position, more urgency to act, takes longer and is harder to resolve, and increases the probability of needing a third party help to resolve.

The Index score is tied to one of 5 general rating categories, which reflect the strength and stability of the consumer’s position.
Less than 60 Emergency / Crisis
60 – 69 Distressed / Unstable
70 – 79 Weakening / At-Risk
80 – 89 Good / Stable
90 and Above Excellent / Secure

What Does the Index Measure?
We measure the 5 categories of personal finance that reflect or lead to a secure, stable financial life—Employment, Housing, Credit, Household Budget and Net Worth. All are equally important, so have given each category equal weighting.

   Title: Projection of General government net lending/borrowing for United States
   Frequency: A
   Popularity: 4
   Notes:
   This is a projection of the series General government net lending/borrowing for United States (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GGNLBAUSA188N). Net lending (+)/ borrowing (-) is calculated as revenue minus total expenditure. This is a core Government Finance Statistics (GFS) balance that measures the extent to which general government is either putting financial resources at the disposal of other sectors in the economy and nonresidents (net lending), or utilizing the financial resources generated by other sectors and nonresidents (net borrowing). This balance may be viewed as an indicator of the financial impact of general government activity on the rest of the economy and nonresidents (Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001 (GFSM 2001), paragraph 4.17). Note: Net lending (+)/borrowing (-) is also equal to net acquisition of financial assets minus net incurrence of liabilities.

   This is a projection of the series General government net lending/borrowing for Italy (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GGNLBAITA188N). Net lending (+)/ borrowing (-) is calculated as revenue minus total expenditure. This is a core Government Finance Statistics (GFS) balance that measures the extent to which general government is either putting financial resources at the disposal of other sectors in the economy and nonresidents (net lending), or utilizing the financial resources generated by other sectors and nonresidents (net borrowing). This balance may be viewed as an indicator of the financial impact of general government activity on the rest of the economy and nonresidents (Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001 (GFSM 2001), paragraph 4.17). Note: Net lending (+)/borrowing (-) is also equal to net acquisition of financial assets minus net incurrence of liabilities.

This cash surplus or deficit is closest to the earlier overall budget balance (still missing is lending minus repayments, which are now a financing item under net acquisition of financial assets).

Net lending (+)/ borrowing (-) is calculated as revenue minus total expenditure. This is a core Government Finance Statistics (GFS) balance that measures the extent to which general government is either putting financial resources at the disposal of other sectors in the economy and nonresidents (net lending), or utilizing the financial resources generated by other sectors and nonresidents (net borrowing). This balance may be viewed as an indicator of the financial impact of general government activity on the rest of the economy and nonresidents (Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001 (GFSM 2001), paragraph 4.17). Note: Net lending (+)/borrowing (-) is also equal to net acquisition of financial assets minus net incurrence of liabilities.

   Frequency: M
   Popularity: 1
   Notes:
   Series Is Presented Here As Two Variables--(1)--Original Data, 1879-1953 (2)--Original Data, 1954-1959. Data Cover Internal Revenue Exclusive Of Income Tax. A New Classification Of Receipts Begins In July 1930 (See Daily Treasury Statement Of July 1, 1930). This Series Is Continued On The Old Basis Through June 1933. Thereafter, Receipts Are Those In General And Special Funds, Trust Fund Receipts Being Excluded. Earlier Data Covered Receipts In All Accounts. Miscellaneous Internal Revenue Is Almost Unaffected By This Change And The Discrepancies Between The Data Obtained From Annual Reports For 1932 And 1933, And Data Given In Daily Treasury Statements Respectively Are Insignificant. The Series Has Therefore Been Treated As Continuous. For July 1930-June 1931, The Daily Treasury Statement Shows Receipts Both On The Old And New Basis. In February 1954 The Accounting Procedures For Receipts And Expenditures Were Changed And Later Figures Are No Longer Comparable. Source: U.S. Treasury Department, For 1879-1883 Data: Statement Of The Receipts And Expenditures Of The United States, From 1880 To 1895; For 1884-May 1895 Data: Receipts, Expenditures, And Debts Of The United States, 1789-1895, With Annual Approximations Made By Congress, 1873-1896; Data For June 1895-1953: Daily Statement Of The U.S. Treasury; Except Data For July 1931-June 1932 Which Are From The Annual Report Of The Secretary Of The Treasury On The State Of Finances, 1932, P. 370, And 1933, P. 312.

   Notes:
   This is a projection of the series General government net lending/borrowing for India (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GGNLBAINA188N). Net lending (+)/ borrowing (-) is calculated as revenue minus total expenditure. This is a core Government Finance Statistics (GFS) balance that measures the extent to which general government is either putting financial resources at the disposal of other sectors in the economy and nonresidents (net lending), or utilizing the financial resources generated by other sectors and nonresidents (net borrowing). This balance may be viewed as an indicator of the financial impact of general government activity on the rest of the economy and nonresidents (Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001 (GFSM 2001), paragraph 4.17). Note: Net lending (+)/borrowing (-) is also equal to net acquisition of financial assets minus net incurrence of liabilities.

   Title: Employed full time: Median usual weekly nominal earnings (second quartile): Wage and salary workers: Budget analysts occupations: 16 years and over
   Frequency: A
   Popularity: 1
   Notes:
   Data measure usual weekly earnings of wage and salary workers. Wage and salary workers are workers who receive wages, salaries, commissions, tips, payment in kind, or piece rates. The group includes employees in both the private and public sectors but, for the purposes of the earnings series, it excludes all self-employed persons, both those with incorporated businesses and those with unincorporated businesses.
Usual weekly earnings represent earnings before taxes and other deductions and include any overtime pay, commissions, or tips usually received (at the main job in the case of multiple jobholders). Prior to 1994, respondents were asked how much they usually earned per week. Since January 1994, respondents have been asked to identify the easiest way for them to report earnings (hourly, weekly, biweekly, twice monthly, monthly, annually, or other) and how much they usually earn in the reported time period. Earnings reported on a basis other than weekly are converted to a weekly equivalent. The term "usual" is determined by each respondent's own understanding of the term. If the respondent asks for a definition of "usual," interviewers are instructed to define the term as more than half the weeks worked during the past 4 or 5 months.

   Notes:
   This is a projection of the series General government net lending/borrowing for Brazil (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GGNLBABRA188N). Net lending (+)/ borrowing (-) is calculated as revenue minus total expenditure. This is a core Government Finance Statistics (GFS) balance that measures the extent to which general government is either putting financial resources at the disposal of other sectors in the economy and nonresidents (net lending), or utilizing the financial resources generated by other sectors and nonresidents (net borrowing). This balance may be viewed as an indicator of the financial impact of general government activity on the rest of the economy and nonresidents (Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001 (GFSM 2001), paragraph 4.17). Note: Net lending (+)/borrowing (-) is also equal to net acquisition of financial assets minus net incurrence of liabilities.

   Notes:
   This is a projection of the series General government net lending/borrowing for Province of China Taiwan (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GGNLBATWA188N). Net lending (+)/ borrowing (-) is calculated as revenue minus total expenditure. This is a core Government Finance Statistics (GFS) balance that measures the extent to which general government is either putting financial resources at the disposal of other sectors in the economy and nonresidents (net lending), or utilizing the financial resources generated by other sectors and nonresidents (net borrowing). This balance may be viewed as an indicator of the financial impact of general government activity on the rest of the economy and nonresidents (Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001 (GFSM 2001), paragraph 4.17). Note: Net lending (+)/borrowing (-) is also equal to net acquisition of financial assets minus net incurrence of liabilities.

   Frequency: A
   Popularity: 1
   Notes:
   This is a projection of the series General government net lending/borrowing for Saudi Arabia (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GGNLBASAA188N). Net lending (+)/ borrowing (-) is calculated as revenue minus total expenditure. This is a core Government Finance Statistics (GFS) balance that measures the extent to which general government is either putting financial resources at the disposal of other sectors in the economy and nonresidents (net lending), or utilizing the financial resources generated by other sectors and nonresidents (net borrowing). This balance may be viewed as an indicator of the financial impact of general government activity on the rest of the economy and nonresidents (Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001 (GFSM 2001), paragraph 4.17). Note: Net lending (+)/borrowing (-) is also equal to net acquisition of financial assets minus net incurrence of liabilities.

   Title: Employed full time: Median usual weekly nominal earnings (second quartile): Wage and salary workers: Budget analysts occupations: 16 years and over: Men
   Frequency: A
   Popularity: 1
   Notes:
   Data measure usual weekly earnings of wage and salary workers. Wage and salary workers are workers who receive wages, salaries, commissions, tips, payment in kind, or piece rates. The group includes employees in both the private and public sectors but, for the purposes of the earnings series, it excludes all self-employed persons, both those with incorporated businesses and those with unincorporated businesses.
Usual weekly earnings represent earnings before taxes and other deductions and include any overtime pay, commissions, or tips usually received (at the main job in the case of multiple jobholders). Prior to 1994, respondents were asked how much they usually earned per week. Since January 1994, respondents have been asked to identify the easiest way for them to report earnings (hourly, weekly, biweekly, twice monthly, monthly, annually, or other) and how much they usually earn in the reported time period. Earnings reported on a basis other than weekly are converted to a weekly equivalent. The term "usual" is determined by each respondent's own understanding of the term. If the respondent asks for a definition of "usual," interviewers are instructed to define the term as more than half the weeks worked during the past 4 or 5 months.

   Title: Employed full time: Median usual weekly nominal earnings (second quartile): Wage and salary workers: Budget analysts occupations: 16 years and over: Women
   Frequency: A
   Popularity: 1
   Notes:
   Data measure usual weekly earnings of wage and salary workers. Wage and salary workers are workers who receive wages, salaries, commissions, tips, payment in kind, or piece rates. The group includes employees in both the private and public sectors but, for the purposes of the earnings series, it excludes all self-employed persons, both those with incorporated businesses and those with unincorporated businesses.
Usual weekly earnings represent earnings before taxes and other deductions and include any overtime pay, commissions, or tips usually received (at the main job in the case of multiple jobholders). Prior to 1994, respondents were asked how much they usually earned per week. Since January 1994, respondents have been asked to identify the easiest way for them to report earnings (hourly, weekly, biweekly, twice monthly, monthly, annually, or other) and how much they usually earn in the reported time period. Earnings reported on a basis other than weekly are converted to a weekly equivalent. The term "usual" is determined by each respondent's own understanding of the term. If the respondent asks for a definition of "usual," interviewers are instructed to define the term as more than half the weeks worked during the past 4 or 5 months.
