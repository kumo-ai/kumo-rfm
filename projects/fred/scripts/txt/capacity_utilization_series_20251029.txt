   Notes:
   For a given industry, the capacity utilization rate is equal to an output index divided by a capacity index. The Federal Reserve Board's capacity indexes attempt to capture the concept of sustainable maximum output-the greatest level of output a plant can maintain within the framework of a realistic work schedule, after factoring in normal downtime and assuming sufficient availability of inputs to operate the capital in place.

   Title: Capacity Utilization: Nondurable Manufacturing: Artificial and synthetic fibers and filaments (DISCONTINUED)
   Frequency: M
   Popularity: 1
   Notes:
   For a given industry, the capacity utilization rate is equal to an output index divided by a capacity index. The Federal Reserve Board's capacity indexes attempt to capture the concept of sustainable maximum output-the greatest level of output a plant can maintain within the framework of a realistic work schedule, after factoring in normal downtime and assuming sufficient availability of inputs to operate the capital in place.

NAICS = 32522

   Title: Future Capacity Utilization; Diffusion Index for Texas
   Frequency: M
   Popularity: 1
   Notes:
   Future Capacity Utilization reports the likely direction of capacity utilization for the manufacturing sector over the six months ahead for the state of Texas. Survey responses are used to calculate an index for each indicator. Each index is calculated by subtracting the percentage of respondents reporting a decrease from the percentage reporting an increase. When the share of firms reporting an increase exceeds the share of firms reporting a decrease, the index will be greater than zero, suggesting the indicator has increased over the prior month. If the share of firms reporting a decrease exceeds the share reporting an increase, the index will be below zero, suggesting the indicator has decreased over the prior month. An index will be zero when the number of firms reporting an increase is equal to the number of firms reporting a decrease.

   Title: Relative Importance Weights (Contribution to the Total Industrial Production Index): Mining, Quarrying, and Oil and Gas Extraction: Crude Oil (NAICS = 211111pt.) (DISCONTINUED)
   Frequency: M
   Popularity: 4
   Notes:
   The IP proportions (typically shown in the first column of the relevant tables in the G.17 release) are estimates of the industries' relative contributions to overall growth in the following year. For example, the relative importance weight of the motor vehicles and parts industry is about 6 percent. If output in this industry increased 10 percent in a month, then this gain would boost growth in total IP by 6/10 percentage point (0.06 x 10% = 0.6%).

NAICS = 211111pt.
