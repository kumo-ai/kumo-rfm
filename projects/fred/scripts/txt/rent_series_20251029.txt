28. TTLHH
   Title: Total Households
   Frequency: A
   Popularity: 61
   Notes:
   Household is an occupied housing unit.
 Householder is a person in whose name the housing unit is rented or owned. This person must be at least 15 years old.
 Family household is a household in which there is at least 1 person present who is related to the householder by birth, marriage or adoption. 
 Family is used to refer to a family household. In general, family consists of those related to each other by birth, marriage or adoption.

 This data uses the householder's person weight to describe characteristics of people living in households. As a result, estimates of the number of households do not match estimates of housing units from the Housing Vacancy Survey (HVS). The HVS is weighted to housing units, rather than the population, in order to more accurately estimate the number of occupied and vacant housing units. For more information about the source and accuracy statement of the Annual Social and Economic Supplement (ASEC) of the Current Population Survey (CPS) see the technical documentation accessible at: http://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/cps/technical-documentation/complete.html

29. TTLHHM156N
   Title: Household Estimates
   Frequency: M
   Popularity: 53
   Notes:
   Data from 1982 are revised based on the 1980 Census. Data from 1993 are revised based on the 1990 Census. Data from 2002 are revised based on the 2000 Census.

The householder refers to the person (or one of the persons) in whose name the housing unit is owned or rented or, if there is no such person, any adult member, excluding roomers, boarders, or paid employees. If the house is jointly owned by a married couple, either the husband or the wife may be listed first, thereby becoming the reference person, or householder, to whom the relationship of the other household members is recorded. One person in each household is designated as the "householder."

This data comes from the  Housing Vacancy Survey (HVS) and is weighted to housing units, rather than the population, in order to more accurately estimate the number of occupied and vacant housing units. As a result, estimates of the number of households from the Housing Vacancy Survey (HVS) do not match estimates of households from the Annual Social and Economic Supplement (ASEC).

   Notes:
   Education refers to the reference person's education level, where the reference person is the first member mentioned by the respondent when asked to "Start with the name of the person or one of the persons who owns or rents the home." It is with respect to this person that the relationship of the other consumer unit members is determined.

A consumer unit comprises either: (1) all members of a particular household who are related by blood, marriage, adoption, or other legal arrangements; (2) a person living alone or sharing a household with others or living as a roomer in a private home or lodging house or in permanent living quarters in a hotel or motel, but who is financially independent; or (3) two or more persons living together who use their income to make joint expenditure decisions. Financial independence is determined by the three major expense categories: Housing, food, and other living expenses. To be considered financially independent, at least two of the three major expense categories have to be provided entirely, or in part, by the respondent.
