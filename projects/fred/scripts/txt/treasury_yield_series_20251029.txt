   Title: Treasury Yield: Money Market <100M
   Frequency: M
   Popularity: 52
   Notes:
   On December 15, 2020, the FDIC Board of Directors approved a Final Rule (https://www.fdic.gov/news/board/2020/2020-12-15-notice-dis-a-fr.pdf) making certain revisions to the interest rate restrictions applicable to less than well capitalized institutions (as defined in Section 38 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act), which are effective on April 1, 2021. The interest rate restrictions generally limit a less than well capitalized institution from soliciting deposits by offering rates that significantly exceed rates in its prevailing market.

The Final Rule redefined the "national rate" as the average of rates paid by all insured depository institutions and credit unions for which data is available, with rates weighted by each institution's share of domestic deposits. The "national rate cap" is calculated as the higher of: (1) the national rate plus 75 basis points; or (2) 120 percent of the current yield on similar maturity U.S. Treasury obligations plus 75 basis points. The national rate cap for non-maturity deposits is the higher of the national rate plus 75 basis points or the federal funds rate plus 75 basis points.

A less than well capitalized institution may use the "local rate cap" in place of the national rate cap for deposits gathered from within the institution's local market area. The Final Rule redefined the "local rate cap" for a particular deposit product as 90 percent of the highest rate offered on the deposit product by an institution or credit union accepting deposits at a physical location within the institution's local market area.

In accordance with Section 337.7(d), an insured depository institution that seeks to pay a rate of interest up to its local market rate cap shall provide notice and evidence of the highest rate paid on a particular deposit product in the institution's local market areas to the appropriate FDIC regional director. The institution shall update its evidence and calculations for existing and new accounts monthly unless otherwise instructed by the appropriate FDIC regional director, and retain such information available for at least the two most recent examination cycles and, upon the FDIC's request, provide the documentation to the appropriate FDIC regional office and to examination staff during any subsequent examinations.

   Frequency: M
   Popularity: 37
   Notes:
   On December 15, 2020, the FDIC Board of Directors approved a Final Rule (https://www.fdic.gov/news/board/2020/2020-12-15-notice-dis-a-fr.pdf) making certain revisions to the interest rate restrictions applicable to less than well capitalized institutions (as defined in Section 38 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act), which are effective on April 1, 2021. The interest rate restrictions generally limit a less than well capitalized institution from soliciting deposits by offering rates that significantly exceed rates in its prevailing market.

The Final Rule redefined the "national rate" as the average of rates paid by all insured depository institutions and credit unions for which data is available, with rates weighted by each institution's share of domestic deposits. The "national rate cap" is calculated as the higher of: (1) the national rate plus 75 basis points; or (2) 120 percent of the current yield on similar maturity U.S. Treasury obligations plus 75 basis points. The national rate cap for non-maturity deposits is the higher of the national rate plus 75 basis points or the federal funds rate plus 75 basis points.

A less than well capitalized institution may use the "local rate cap" in place of the national rate cap for deposits gathered from within the institution's local market area. The Final Rule redefined the "local rate cap" for a particular deposit product as 90 percent of the highest rate offered on the deposit product by an institution or credit union accepting deposits at a physical location within the institution's local market area.

In accordance with Section 337.7(d), an insured depository institution that seeks to pay a rate of interest up to its local market rate cap shall provide notice and evidence of the highest rate paid on a particular deposit product in the institution's local market areas to the appropriate FDIC regional director. The institution shall update its evidence and calculations for existing and new accounts monthly unless otherwise instructed by the appropriate FDIC regional director, and retain such information available for at least the two most recent examination cycles and, upon the FDIC's request, provide the documentation to the appropriate FDIC regional office and to examination staff during any subsequent examinations.

   Title: Treasury Yield: Savings

   Notes:
   On December 15, 2020, the FDIC Board of Directors approved a Final Rule (https://www.fdic.gov/news/board/2020/2020-12-15-notice-dis-a-fr.pdf) making certain revisions to the interest rate restrictions applicable to less than well capitalized institutions (as defined in Section 38 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act), which are effective on April 1, 2021. The interest rate restrictions generally limit a less than well capitalized institution from soliciting deposits by offering rates that significantly exceed rates in its prevailing market.

The Final Rule redefined the "national rate" as the average of rates paid by all insured depository institutions and credit unions for which data is available, with rates weighted by each institution's share of domestic deposits. The "national rate cap" is calculated as the higher of: (1) the national rate plus 75 basis points; or (2) 120 percent of the current yield on similar maturity U.S. Treasury obligations plus 75 basis points. The national rate cap for non-maturity deposits is the higher of the national rate plus 75 basis points or the federal funds rate plus 75 basis points.

A less than well capitalized institution may use the "local rate cap" in place of the national rate cap for deposits gathered from within the institution's local market area. The Final Rule redefined the "local rate cap" for a particular deposit product as 90 percent of the highest rate offered on the deposit product by an institution or credit union accepting deposits at a physical location within the institution's local market area.

In accordance with Section 337.7(d), an insured depository institution that seeks to pay a rate of interest up to its local market rate cap shall provide notice and evidence of the highest rate paid on a particular deposit product in the institution's local market areas to the appropriate FDIC regional director. The institution shall update its evidence and calculations for existing and new accounts monthly unless otherwise instructed by the appropriate FDIC regional director, and retain such information available for at least the two most recent examination cycles and, upon the FDIC's request, provide the documentation to the appropriate FDIC regional office and to examination staff during any subsequent examinations.

   Title: Contributions to the Cleveland Financial Stress Index: Treasury Yield Curve Spread (DISCONTINUED)
   Frequency: D
   Popularity: 3
   Notes:
   In May of 2016, the source discovered errors in the calculation of the CFSI and began a detailed review of the index and its underlying model. Following that review, the source decided to discontinue the CFSI. https://www.clevelandfed.org/en/our-research/indicators-and-data/cleveland-financial-stress-index.aspx

The source has posted to their website a message regarding this release: Cleveland Financial Stress Index under review and a revised index expected in the fourth quarter of 2016. A thorough review of the index is being conducted to both simplify the index and enhance its robustness, while also taking into consideration changes in financial markets and institutions. This review and the revisions to the CFSI are expected to be completed sometime during the fourth quarter of this year, and additional details will be made available at that time. Thank you for your patience while we improve the CFSI.

This chart shows the contribution of the Treasury yield curve spread to the CFSI. The spread is a useful predictor of recessions and real economic activity. It is calculated as the difference between the 3-Month and 10-Year US Treasury yields. The spread captures the combination of long-term uncertainty and short-term liquidity needed at the outset of- and during-recessionary times.

The "national rate cap" is calculated as the higher of: (1) the national rate plus 75 basis points; or (2) 120 percent of the current yield on similar maturity U.S. Treasury obligations plus 75 basis points. The national rate cap for non-maturity deposits is the higher of the national rate plus 75 basis points or the federal funds rate plus 75 basis points.

A less than well capitalized institution may use the "local rate cap" in place of the national rate cap for deposits gathered from within the institution's local market area. The Final Rule redefined the "local rate cap" for a particular deposit product as 90 percent of the highest rate offered on the deposit product by an institution or credit union accepting deposits at a physical location within the institution's local market area.

In accordance with Section 337.7(d), an insured depository institution that seeks to pay a rate of interest up to its local market rate cap shall provide notice and evidence of the highest rate paid on a particular deposit product in the institution's local market areas to the appropriate FDIC regional director. The institution shall update its evidence and calculations for existing and new accounts monthly unless otherwise instructed by the appropriate FDIC regional director, and retain such information available for at least the two most recent examination cycles and, upon the FDIC's request, provide the documentation to the appropriate FDIC regional office and to examination staff during any subsequent examinations.

   Title: ICE BofA US High Yield Index Option-Adjusted Spread
   Frequency: D
   Popularity: 98
   Notes:
   The ICE BofA Option-Adjusted Spreads (OASs) are the calculated spreads between a computed OAS index of all bonds in a given rating category and a spot Treasury curve. An OAS index is constructed using each constituent bond's OAS, weighted by market capitalization. The ICE BofA High Yield Master II OAS uses an index of bonds that are below investment grade (those rated BB or below).
This data represents the ICE BofA US High Yield Index value, which tracks the performance of US dollar denominated below investment grade rated corporate debt publicly issued in the US domestic market. To qualify for inclusion in the index, securities must have a below investment grade rating (based on an average of Moody's, S&P, and Fitch) and an investment grade rated country of risk (based on an average of Moody's, S&P, and Fitch foreign currency long term sovereign debt ratings). Each security must have greater than 1 year of remaining maturity, a fixed coupon schedule, and a minimum amount outstanding of $100 million. Original issue zero coupon bonds, "global" securities (debt issued simultaneously in the eurobond and US domestic bond markets), 144a securities and pay-in-kind securities, including toggle notes, qualify for inclusion in the Index. Callable perpetual securities qualify provided they are at least one year from the first call date. Fixed-to-floating rate securities also qualify provided they are callable within the fixed rate period and are at least one year from the last call prior to the date the bond transitions from a fixed to a floating rate security. DRD-eligible and defaulted securities are excluded from the Index.

ICE BofA Explains the Construction Methodology of this series as:
Index constituents are capitalization-weighted based on their current amount outstanding. With the exception of U.S. mortgage pass-throughs and U.S. structured products (ABS, CMBS and CMOs), accrued interest is calculated assuming next-day settlement. Accrued interest for U.S. mortgage pass-through and U.S. structured products is calculated assuming same-day settlement. Cash flows from bond payments that are received during the month are retained in the index until the end of the month and then are removed as part of the rebalancing. Cash does not earn any reinvestment income while it is held in the Index. The Index is rebalanced on the last calendar day of the month, based on information available up to and including the third business day before the last business day of the month. Issues that meet the qualifying criteria are included in the Index for the following month. Issues that no longer meet the criteria during the course of the month remain in the Index until the next month-end rebalancing at which point they are removed from the Index.

When the last calendar day of the month takes place on the weekend, weekend observations will occur as a result of month ending accrued interest adjustments.

   Title: National Rate: Savings
   Frequency: M
   Popularity: 56
   Notes:
   On December 15, 2020, the FDIC Board of Directors approved a Final Rule (https://www.fdic.gov/news/board/2020/2020-12-15-notice-dis-a-fr.pdf) making certain revisions to the interest rate restrictions applicable to less than well capitalized institutions (as defined in Section 38 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act), which are effective on April 1, 2021. The interest rate restrictions generally limit a less than well capitalized institution from soliciting deposits by offering rates that significantly exceed rates in its prevailing market.

The Final Rule redefined the "national rate" as the average of rates paid by all insured depository institutions and credit unions for which data is available, with rates weighted by each institution's share of domestic deposits. The "national rate cap" is calculated as the higher of: (1) the national rate plus 75 basis points; or (2) 120 percent of the current yield on similar maturity U.S. Treasury obligations plus 75 basis points. The national rate cap for non-maturity deposits is the higher of the national rate plus 75 basis points or the federal funds rate plus 75 basis points.

A less than well capitalized institution may use the "local rate cap" in place of the national rate cap for deposits gathered from within the institution's local market area. The Final Rule redefined the "local rate cap" for a particular deposit product as 90 percent of the highest rate offered on the deposit product by an institution or credit union accepting deposits at a physical location within the institution's local market area.

In accordance with Section 337.7(d), an insured depository institution that seeks to pay a rate of interest up to its local market rate cap shall provide notice and evidence of the highest rate paid on a particular deposit product in the institution's local market areas to the appropriate FDIC regional director. The institution shall update its evidence and calculations for existing and new accounts monthly unless otherwise instructed by the appropriate FDIC regional director, and retain such information available for at least the two most recent examination cycles and, upon the FDIC's request, provide the documentation to the appropriate FDIC regional office and to examination staff during any subsequent examinations.

   Frequency: M
   Popularity: 54
   Notes:
   The spot rate for any maturity is defined as the yield on a bond that gives a single payment at that maturity. This is called a zero coupon bond. Because high quality zero coupon bonds are not generally available, the HQM methodology computes the spot rates so as to make them consistent with the yields on other high quality bonds. The HQM yield curve uses data from a set of high quality corporate bonds rated AAA, AA, or A that accurately represent the high quality corporate bond market.

The HQM methodology projects yields beyond 30 years maturity out to 100 years maturity to get discount rates for long-dated pension liabilities.

The "national rate cap" is calculated as the higher of: (1) the national rate plus 75 basis points; or (2) 120 percent of the current yield on similar maturity U.S. Treasury obligations plus 75 basis points. The national rate cap for non-maturity deposits is the higher of the national rate plus 75 basis points or the federal funds rate plus 75 basis points.

A less than well capitalized institution may use the "local rate cap" in place of the national rate cap for deposits gathered from within the institution's local market area. The Final Rule redefined the "local rate cap" for a particular deposit product as 90 percent of the highest rate offered on the deposit product by an institution or credit union accepting deposits at a physical location within the institution's local market area.

In accordance with Section 337.7(d), an insured depository institution that seeks to pay a rate of interest up to its local market rate cap shall provide notice and evidence of the highest rate paid on a particular deposit product in the institution's local market areas to the appropriate FDIC regional director. The institution shall update its evidence and calculations for existing and new accounts monthly unless otherwise instructed by the appropriate FDIC regional director, and retain such information available for at least the two most recent examination cycles and, upon the FDIC's request, provide the documentation to the appropriate FDIC regional office and to examination staff during any subsequent examinations.

   Notes:
   The spot rate for any maturity is defined as the yield on a bond that gives a single payment at that maturity. This is called a zero coupon bond. Because high quality zero coupon bonds are not generally available, the HQM methodology computes the spot rates so as to make them consistent with the yields on other high quality bonds. The HQM yield curve uses data from a set of high quality corporate bonds rated AAA, AA, or A that accurately represent the high quality corporate bond market. 

The HQM methodology projects yields beyond 30 years maturity out to 100 years maturity to get discount rates for long-dated pension liabilities.

   Notes:
   On December 15, 2020, the FDIC Board of Directors approved a Final Rule (https://www.fdic.gov/news/board/2020/2020-12-15-notice-dis-a-fr.pdf) making certain revisions to the interest rate restrictions applicable to less than well capitalized institutions (as defined in Section 38 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act), which are effective on April 1, 2021. The interest rate restrictions generally limit a less than well capitalized institution from soliciting deposits by offering rates that significantly exceed rates in its prevailing market.

The Final Rule redefined the "national rate" as the average of rates paid by all insured depository institutions and credit unions for which data is available, with rates weighted by each institution's share of domestic deposits. The "national rate cap" is calculated as the higher of: (1) the national rate plus 75 basis points; or (2) 120 percent of the current yield on similar maturity U.S. Treasury obligations plus 75 basis points. The national rate cap for non-maturity deposits is the higher of the national rate plus 75 basis points or the federal funds rate plus 75 basis points.

A less than well capitalized institution may use the "local rate cap" in place of the national rate cap for deposits gathered from within the institution's local market area. The Final Rule redefined the "local rate cap" for a particular deposit product as 90 percent of the highest rate offered on the deposit product by an institution or credit union accepting deposits at a physical location within the institution's local market area.

In accordance with Section 337.7(d), an insured depository institution that seeks to pay a rate of interest up to its local market rate cap shall provide notice and evidence of the highest rate paid on a particular deposit product in the institution's local market areas to the appropriate FDIC regional director.

   Title: National Rate: 60 Month CD <100M
   Frequency: M
   Popularity: 21
   Notes:
   On December 15, 2020, the FDIC Board of Directors approved a Final Rule (https://www.fdic.gov/news/board/2020/2020-12-15-notice-dis-a-fr.pdf) making certain revisions to the interest rate restrictions applicable to less than well capitalized institutions (as defined in Section 38 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act), which are effective on April 1, 2021. The interest rate restrictions generally limit a less than well capitalized institution from soliciting deposits by offering rates that significantly exceed rates in its prevailing market.

The Final Rule redefined the "national rate" as the average of rates paid by all insured depository institutions and credit unions for which data is available, with rates weighted by each institution's share of domestic deposits. The "national rate cap" is calculated as the higher of: (1) the national rate plus 75 basis points; or (2) 120 percent of the current yield on similar maturity U.S. Treasury obligations plus 75 basis points. The national rate cap for non-maturity deposits is the higher of the national rate plus 75 basis points or the federal funds rate plus 75 basis points.

A less than well capitalized institution may use the "local rate cap" in place of the national rate cap for deposits gathered from within the institution's local market area. The Final Rule redefined the "local rate cap" for a particular deposit product as 90 percent of the highest rate offered on the deposit product by an institution or credit union accepting deposits at a physical location within the institution's local market area.

In accordance with Section 337.7(d), an insured depository institution that seeks to pay a rate of interest up to its local market rate cap shall provide notice and evidence of the highest rate paid on a particular deposit product in the institution's local market areas to the appropriate FDIC regional director. The institution shall update its evidence and calculations for existing and new accounts monthly unless otherwise instructed by the appropriate FDIC regional director, and retain such information available for at least the two most recent examination cycles and, upon the FDIC's request, provide the documentation to the appropriate FDIC regional office and to examination staff during any subsequent examinations.

216. CROASTIER0
   Title: AD&Co US Mortgage High Yield Index, Credit-and-Option-Adjusted Spread: Tier 0
   Frequency: M
   Popularity: 21
   Notes:
   The AD&Co US Mortgage High Yield Index crOAS, credit-and-option-adjusted spread, is an extension of the traditional OAS measure. On a set of 20 standardized, probabilistically weighted, market-and-model stress scenarios, AD&Co computes a discount rate that equates expected present value of tranche's cash flows to the observed market price; the cash flows are loss-adjusted using AD&Co's LoanDynamics Model (LDM).

Investors and fund managers can use the index to assess the broad market returns, risks and opportunities available through investing in a market-weighted, passive portfolio of US mortgage credit risk transfer instruments. The Index also provides a means of comparing the returns of an actively managed portfolio against a passive, naive market portfolio as approximated by the Index. The Mid-Tier and its sub-indices allow for approximations of performance comparisons by vintage or age, across the capital stack, and by initial credit risk level and/or vintage as indicated by original attachment point.

Until February of 2022, AD&Co has been computing crOAS relative to the Libor-swap rate curve that is set to retire in 2023. Following the prevailing market trend and starting from its February-end report, AD&Co began computing the crOAS metric relative to the Treasury-curve benchmark. Given the differences between the two rate curves, this change should account for approximately 6 to 12 bps widening in spread for the AD&Co CRT Indices.

   Title: Contributions to the Cleveland Financial Stress Index: Covered Interest Spread (DISCONTINUED)
   Frequency: D
   Popularity: 1
   Notes:
   In May of 2016, the source discovered errors in the calculation of the CFSI and began a detailed review of the index and its underlying model. Following that review, the source decided to discontinue the CFSI. https://www.clevelandfed.org/en/our-research/indicators-and-data/cleveland-financial-stress-index.aspx

The source has posted to their website a message regarding this release: Cleveland Financial Stress Index under review and a revised index expected in the fourth quarter of 2016. A thorough review of the index is being conducted to both simplify the index and enhance its robustness, while also taking into consideration changes in financial markets and institutions. This review and the revisions to the CFSI are expected to be completed sometime during the fourth quarter of this year, and additional details will be made available at that time. Thank you for your patience while we improve the CFSI.

This chart shows the contribution of the covered interest spread to the CFSI. This spread measures the difference between the 90-Day UK Treasury yield and the 90-Day US Treasury Yield. It contains information about uncertainty in government bond markets. A widening spread signals unwillingness to hold a government's debt, which implies difficulty in acquiring liquidity for governments, signaling the onset of stress.

   Popularity: 10
   Notes:
   The spot rate for any maturity is defined as the yield on a bond that gives a single payment at that maturity. This is called a zero coupon bond. Because high quality zero coupon bonds are not generally available, the HQM methodology computes the spot rates so as to make them consistent with the yields on other high quality bonds. The HQM yield curve uses data from a set of high quality corporate bonds rated AAA, AA, or A that accurately represent the high quality corporate bond market. 

The HQM methodology projects yields beyond 30 years maturity out to 100 years maturity to get discount rates for long-dated pension liabilities.

   Title: National Rate: 6 Month CD <100M
   Frequency: M
   Popularity: 8
   Notes:
   On December 15, 2020, the FDIC Board of Directors approved a Final Rule (https://www.fdic.gov/news/board/2020/2020-12-15-notice-dis-a-fr.pdf) making certain revisions to the interest rate restrictions applicable to less than well capitalized institutions (as defined in Section 38 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act), which are effective on April 1, 2021. The interest rate restrictions generally limit a less than well capitalized institution from soliciting deposits by offering rates that significantly exceed rates in its prevailing market.

The Final Rule redefined the "national rate" as the average of rates paid by all insured depository institutions and credit unions for which data is available, with rates weighted by each institution's share of domestic deposits. The "national rate cap" is calculated as the higher of: (1) the national rate plus 75 basis points; or (2) 120 percent of the current yield on similar maturity U.S. Treasury obligations plus 75 basis points. The national rate cap for non-maturity deposits is the higher of the national rate plus 75 basis points or the federal funds rate plus 75 basis points.

A less than well capitalized institution may use the "local rate cap" in place of the national rate cap for deposits gathered from within the institution's local market area. The Final Rule redefined the "local rate cap" for a particular deposit product as 90 percent of the highest rate offered on the deposit product by an institution or credit union accepting deposits at a physical location within the institution's local market area.

In accordance with Section 337.7(d), an insured depository institution that seeks to pay a rate of interest up to its local market rate cap shall provide notice and evidence of the highest rate paid on a particular deposit product in the institution's local market areas to the appropriate FDIC regional director. The institution shall update its evidence and calculations for existing and new accounts monthly unless otherwise instructed by the appropriate FDIC regional director, and retain such information available for at least the two most recent examination cycles and, upon the FDIC's request, provide the documentation to the appropriate FDIC regional office and to examination staff during any subsequent examinations.

253. CROASTIER3
   Title: AD&Co US Mortgage High Yield Index, Credit-and-Option-Adjusted Spread: Tier 3
   Frequency: M
   Popularity: 12
   Notes:
   The AD&Co US Mortgage High Yield Index crOAS, credit-and-option-adjusted spread, is an extension of the traditional OAS measure. On a set of 20 standardized, probabilistically weighted, market-and-model stress scenarios, AD&Co computes a discount rate that equates expected present value of tranche's cash flows to the observed market price; the cash flows are loss-adjusted using AD&Co's LoanDynamics Model (LDM).

Investors and fund managers can use the index to assess the broad market returns, risks and opportunities available through investing in a market-weighted, passive portfolio of US mortgage credit risk transfer instruments. The Index also provides a means of comparing the returns of an actively managed portfolio against a passive, naive market portfolio as approximated by the Index. The Mid-Tier and its sub-indices allow for approximations of performance comparisons by vintage or age, across the capital stack, and by initial credit risk level and/or vintage as indicated by original attachment point.

Until February of 2022, AD&Co has been computing crOAS relative to the Libor-swap rate curve that is set to retire in 2023. Following the prevailing market trend and starting from its February-end report, AD&Co began computing the crOAS metric relative to the Treasury-curve benchmark. Given the differences between the two rate curves, this change should account for approximately 6 to 12 bps widening in spread for the AD&Co CRT Indices.

   Title: Contributions to the Cleveland Financial Stress Index: Corporate Bond Spread (DISCONTINUED)
   Frequency: D
   Popularity: 1
   Notes:
   In May of 2016, the source discovered errors in the calculation of the CFSI and began a detailed review of the index and its underlying model. Following that review, the source decided to discontinue the CFSI. https://www.clevelandfed.org/en/our-research/indicators-and-data/cleveland-financial-stress-index.aspx

The source has posted to their website a message regarding this release: Cleveland Financial Stress Index under review and a revised index expected in the fourth quarter of 2016. A thorough review of the index is being conducted to both simplify the index and enhance its robustness, while also taking into consideration changes in financial markets and institutions. This review and the revisions to the CFSI are expected to be completed sometime during the fourth quarter of this year, and additional details will be made available at that time. Thank you for your patience while we improve the CFSI.

This chart shows the contribution of the corporate bond spread to the CFSI. This spread measures the difference between the 10-Year Moody's Aaa-rated corporate bond yield and 10-Year US Treasury yield, which captures medium- to long-term corporate risk for all sectors. This is a useful stress indicator because when the likelihood of losses increases, firms have trouble financing debt and may be less able to obtain liquidity, which implies greater stress.

   Title: Contributions to the Cleveland Financial Stress Index: Bank Bond Spread (DISCONTINUED)
   Frequency: D
   Popularity: 1
   Notes:
   In May of 2016, the source discovered errors in the calculation of the CFSI and began a detailed review of the index and its underlying model. Following that review, the source decided to discontinue the CFSI. https://www.clevelandfed.org/en/our-research/indicators-and-data/cleveland-financial-stress-index.aspx

The source has posted to their website a message regarding this release: Cleveland Financial Stress Index under review and a revised index expected in the fourth quarter of 2016. A thorough review of the index is being conducted to both simplify the index and enhance its robustness, while also taking into consideration changes in financial markets and institutions. This review and the revisions to the CFSI are expected to be completed sometime during the fourth quarter of this year, and additional details will be made available at that time. Thank you for your patience while we improve the CFSI.

This chart shows the contribution of the bank bond spread to the CFSI. This spread is measured as the difference between the 10-Year A-Rated bond yield and the 10-Year US Treasury Yield. It captures the broad perceptions of medium- to long-term risk in banks issuing A-Rated bonds.

   Title: 60-Year High Quality Market (HQM) Corporate Bond Spot Rate
   Frequency: M
   Popularity: 6
   Notes:
   The spot rate for any maturity is defined as the yield on a bond that gives a single payment at that maturity. This is called a zero coupon bond. Because high quality zero coupon bonds are not generally available, the HQM methodology computes the spot rates so as to make them consistent with the yields on other high quality bonds. The HQM yield curve uses data from a set of high quality corporate bonds rated AAA, AA, or A that accurately represent the high quality corporate bond market. 

The HQM methodology projects yields beyond 30 years maturity out to 100 years maturity to get discount rates for long-dated pension liabilities.

   Frequency: M
   Popularity: 5
   Notes:
   On December 15, 2020, the FDIC Board of Directors approved a Final Rule (https://www.fdic.gov/news/board/2020/2020-12-15-notice-dis-a-fr.pdf) making certain revisions to the interest rate restrictions applicable to less than well capitalized institutions (as defined in Section 38 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act), which are effective on April 1, 2021. The interest rate restrictions generally limit a less than well capitalized institution from soliciting deposits by offering rates that significantly exceed rates in its prevailing market.

The Final Rule redefined the "national rate" as the average of rates paid by all insured depository institutions and credit unions for which data is available, with rates weighted by each institution's share of domestic deposits. The "national rate cap" is calculated as the higher of: (1) the national rate plus 75 basis points; or (2) 120 percent of the current yield on similar maturity U.S. Treasury obligations plus 75 basis points. The national rate cap for non-maturity deposits is the higher of the national rate plus 75 basis points or the federal funds rate plus 75 basis points.

A less than well capitalized institution may use the "local rate cap" in place of the national rate cap for deposits gathered from within the institution's local market area. The Final Rule redefined the "local rate cap" for a particular deposit product as 90 percent of the highest rate offered on the deposit product by an institution or credit union accepting deposits at a physical location within the institution's local market area.

In accordance with Section 337.7(d), an insured depository institution that seeks to pay a rate of interest up to its local market rate cap shall provide notice and evidence of the highest rate paid on a particular deposit product in the institution's local market areas to the appropriate FDIC regional director. The institution shall update its evidence and calculations for existing and new accounts monthly unless otherwise instructed by the appropriate FDIC regional director, and retain such information available for at least the two most recent examination cycles and, upon the FDIC's request, provide the documentation to the appropriate FDIC regional office and to examination staff during any subsequent examinations.

   Title: AD&Co US Mortgage High Yield Index, Credit-and-Option-Adjusted Spread: Tier 2
   Frequency: M
   Popularity: 8
   Notes:
   The AD&Co US Mortgage High Yield Index crOAS, credit-and-option-adjusted spread, is an extension of the traditional OAS measure. On a set of 20 standardized, probabilistically weighted, market-and-model stress scenarios, AD&Co computes a discount rate that equates expected present value of tranche's cash flows to the observed market price; the cash flows are loss-adjusted using AD&Co's LoanDynamics Model (LDM).

Investors and fund managers can use the index to assess the broad market returns, risks and opportunities available through investing in a market-weighted, passive portfolio of US mortgage credit risk transfer instruments. The Index also provides a means of comparing the returns of an actively managed portfolio against a passive, naive market portfolio as approximated by the Index. The Mid-Tier and its sub-indices allow for approximations of performance comparisons by vintage or age, across the capital stack, and by initial credit risk level and/or vintage as indicated by original attachment point.

Until February of 2022, AD&Co has been computing crOAS relative to the Libor-swap rate curve that is set to retire in 2023. Following the prevailing market trend and starting from its February-end report, AD&Co began computing the crOAS metric relative to the Treasury-curve benchmark. Given the differences between the two rate curves, this change should account for approximately 6 to 12 bps widening in spread for the AD&Co CRT Indices.

   Notes:
   The spot rate for any maturity is defined as the yield on a bond that gives a single payment at that maturity. This is called a zero coupon bond. Because high quality zero coupon bonds are not generally available, the HQM methodology computes the spot rates so as to make them consistent with the yields on other high quality bonds. The HQM yield curve uses data from a set of high quality corporate bonds rated AAA, AA, or A that accurately represent the high quality corporate bond market. 

The HQM methodology projects yields beyond 30 years maturity out to 100 years maturity to get discount rates for long-dated pension liabilities.

   Title: National Rate Cap: 6 Month CD <100M
   Frequency: M
   Popularity: 3
   Notes:
   On December 15, 2020, the FDIC Board of Directors approved a Final Rule (https://www.fdic.gov/news/board/2020/2020-12-15-notice-dis-a-fr.pdf) making certain revisions to the interest rate restrictions applicable to less than well capitalized institutions (as defined in Section 38 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act), which are effective on April 1, 2021. The interest rate restrictions generally limit a less than well capitalized institution from soliciting deposits by offering rates that significantly exceed rates in its prevailing market.

The Final Rule redefined the "national rate" as the average of rates paid by all insured depository institutions and credit unions for which data is available, with rates weighted by each institution's share of domestic deposits. The "national rate cap" is calculated as the higher of: (1) the national rate plus 75 basis points; or (2) 120 percent of the current yield on similar maturity U.S. Treasury obligations plus 75 basis points. The national rate cap for non-maturity deposits is the higher of the national rate plus 75 basis points or the federal funds rate plus 75 basis points.

A less than well capitalized institution may use the "local rate cap" in place of the national rate cap for deposits gathered from within the institution's local market area. The Final Rule redefined the "local rate cap" for a particular deposit product as 90 percent of the highest rate offered on the deposit product by an institution or credit union accepting deposits at a physical location within the institution's local market area.

In accordance with Section 337.7(d), an insured depository institution that seeks to pay a rate of interest up to its local market rate cap shall provide notice and evidence of the highest rate paid on a particular deposit product in the institution's local market areas to the appropriate FDIC regional director. The institution shall update its evidence and calculations for existing and new accounts monthly unless otherwise instructed by the appropriate FDIC regional director, and retain such information available for at least the two most recent examination cycles and, upon the FDIC's request, provide the documentation to the appropriate FDIC regional office and to examination staff during any subsequent examinations.

The source has posted to their website a message regarding this release: Cleveland Financial Stress Index under review and a revised index expected in the fourth quarter of 2016. A thorough review of the index is being conducted to both simplify the index and enhance its robustness, while also taking into consideration changes in financial markets and institutions. This review and the revisions to the CFSI are expected to be completed sometime during the fourth quarter of this year, and additional details will be made available at that time. Thank you for your patience while we improve the CFSI.

This chart shows the contribution of the commercial mortgage-backed security spread to CFSI. This spread is measured as the difference between the yield on commercial mortgage-backed securities and 5-Year Treasury. It captures the ability of originators to raise capital and the relative riskiness of the securitized asset

The interest rate restrictions generally limit a less than well capitalized institution from soliciting deposits by offering rates that significantly exceed rates in its prevailing market.

The Final Rule redefined the "national rate" as the average of rates paid by all insured depository institutions and credit unions for which data is available, with rates weighted by each institution's share of domestic deposits. The "national rate cap" is calculated as the higher of: (1) the national rate plus 75 basis points; or (2) 120 percent of the current yield on similar maturity U.S. Treasury obligations plus 75 basis points. The national rate cap for non-maturity deposits is the higher of the national rate plus 75 basis points or the federal funds rate plus 75 basis points.

A less than well capitalized institution may use the "local rate cap" in place of the national rate cap for deposits gathered from within the institution's local market area. The Final Rule redefined the "local rate cap" for a particular deposit product as 90 percent of the highest rate offered on the deposit product by an institution or credit union accepting deposits at a physical location within the institution's local market area.

In accordance with Section 337.7(d), an insured depository institution that seeks to pay a rate of interest up to its local market rate cap shall provide notice and evidence of the highest rate paid on a particular deposit product in the institution's local market areas to the appropriate FDIC regional director. The institution shall update its evidence and calculations for existing and new accounts monthly unless otherwise instructed by the appropriate FDIC regional director, and retain such information available for at least the two most recent examination cycles and, upon the FDIC's request, provide the documentation to the appropriate FDIC regional office and to examination staff during any subsequent examinations.

   Notes:
   In May of 2016, the source discovered errors in the calculation of the CFSI and began a detailed review of the index and its underlying model. Following that review, the source decided to discontinue the CFSI. https://www.clevelandfed.org/en/our-research/indicators-and-data/cleveland-financial-stress-index.aspx

The source has posted to their website a message regarding this release: Cleveland Financial Stress Index under review and a revised index expected in the fourth quarter of 2016. A thorough review of the index is being conducted to both simplify the index and enhance its robustness, while also taking into consideration changes in financial markets and institutions. This review and the revisions to the CFSI are expected to be completed sometime during the fourth quarter of this year, and additional details will be made available at that time. Thank you for your patience while we improve the CFSI.

This chart shows the contribution of the asset-backed security spread to CFSI. This spread is measured as the difference between the asset-backed bond yield and the 5-Year Treasury. It captures the ability of originators to raise capital and the relative riskiness of the securitized asset.

This chart shows the contribution of the commercial paper -T-Bill Spread to the CFSI. This spread measures the difference between the 90-Day financial commercial paper rate and the 90-Day US Treasury Yield. It captures the short-term risk premium on financial companies' debt. A widening spread signals increases in the underlying risk of financial companies' operations.

The interbank liquidity spread is measured as the difference between the 3-Month LIBOR and the 3-Month US Treasury Yield. The spread reflects the perception of counterparty risk in interbank lending by measuring the risk premium associated with lending to commercial banks. The spread increases when either market liquidity is scarce or when counterparty default risk increases, both of which are associated with increasing financial stress.

   Title: 6.5-Year High Quality Market (HQM) Corporate Bond Spot Rate
   Frequency: M
   Popularity: 2
   Notes:
   The spot rate for any maturity is defined as the yield on a bond that gives a single payment at that maturity. This is called a zero coupon bond. Because high quality zero coupon bonds are not generally available, the HQM methodology computes the spot rates so as to make them consistent with the yields on other high quality bonds. The HQM yield curve uses data from a set of high quality corporate bonds rated AAA, AA, or A that accurately represent the high quality corporate bond market. 

The HQM methodology projects yields beyond 30 years maturity out to 100 years maturity to get discount rates for long-dated pension liabilities.

   Frequency: M
   Popularity: 1
   Notes:
   On December 15, 2020, the FDIC Board of Directors approved a Final Rule (https://www.fdic.gov/news/board/2020/2020-12-15-notice-dis-a-fr.pdf) making certain revisions to the interest rate restrictions applicable to less than well capitalized institutions (as defined in Section 38 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act), which are effective on April 1, 2021. The interest rate restrictions generally limit a less than well capitalized institution from soliciting deposits by offering rates that significantly exceed rates in its prevailing market.

The Final Rule redefined the "national rate" as the average of rates paid by all insured depository institutions and credit unions for which data is available, with rates weighted by each institution's share of domestic deposits. The "national rate cap" is calculated as the higher of: (1) the national rate plus 75 basis points; or (2) 120 percent of the current yield on similar maturity U.S. Treasury obligations plus 75 basis points. The national rate cap for non-maturity deposits is the higher of the national rate plus 75 basis points or the federal funds rate plus 75 basis points.

A less than well capitalized institution may use the "local rate cap" in place of the national rate cap for deposits gathered from within the institution's local market area. The Final Rule redefined the "local rate cap" for a particular deposit product as 90 percent of the highest rate offered on the deposit product by an institution or credit union accepting deposits at a physical location within the institution's local market area.

In accordance with Section 337.7(d), an insured depository institution that seeks to pay a rate of interest up to its local market rate cap shall provide notice and evidence of the highest rate paid on a particular deposit product in the institution's local market areas to the appropriate FDIC regional director. The institution shall update its evidence and calculations for existing and new accounts monthly unless otherwise instructed by the appropriate FDIC regional director, and retain such information available for at least the two most recent examination cycles and, upon the FDIC's request, provide the documentation to the appropriate FDIC regional office and to examination staff during any subsequent examinations.

   Frequency: M
   Popularity: 1
   Notes:
   The spot rate for any maturity is defined as the yield on a bond that gives a single payment at that maturity. This is called a zero coupon bond. Because high quality zero coupon bonds are not generally available, the HQM methodology computes the spot rates so as to make them consistent with the yields on other high quality bonds. The HQM yield curve uses data from a set of high quality corporate bonds rated AAA, AA, or A that accurately represent the high quality corporate bond market. 

The HQM methodology projects yields beyond 30 years maturity out to 100 years maturity to get discount rates for long-dated pension liabilities.

Because high quality zero coupon bonds are not generally available, the HQM methodology computes the spot rates so as to make them consistent with the yields on other high quality bonds. The HQM yield curve uses data from a set of high quality corporate bonds rated AAA, AA, or A that accurately represent the high quality corporate bond market. 

The HQM methodology projects yields beyond 30 years maturity out to 100 years maturity to get discount rates for long-dated pension liabilities.

   The spot rate for any maturity is defined as the yield on a bond that gives a single payment at that maturity. This is called a zero coupon bond. Because high quality zero coupon bonds are not generally available, the HQM methodology computes the spot rates so as to make them consistent with the yields on other high quality bonds. The HQM yield curve uses data from a set of high quality corporate bonds rated AAA, AA, or A that accurately represent the high quality corporate bond market. 

The HQM methodology projects yields beyond 30 years maturity out to 100 years maturity to get discount rates for long-dated pension liabilities.

   Frequency: M
   Popularity: 1
   Notes:
   The spot rate for any maturity is defined as the yield on a bond that gives a single payment at that maturity. This is called a zero coupon bond. Because high quality zero coupon bonds are not generally available, the HQM methodology computes the spot rates so as to make them consistent with the yields on other high quality bonds. The HQM yield curve uses data from a set of high quality corporate bonds rated AAA, AA, or A that accurately represent the high quality corporate bond market. 

The HQM methodology projects yields beyond 30 years maturity out to 100 years maturity to get discount rates for long-dated pension liabilities.

   Frequency: M
   Popularity: 1
   Notes:
   The spot rate for any maturity is defined as the yield on a bond that gives a single payment at that maturity. This is called a zero coupon bond. Because high quality zero coupon bonds are not generally available, the HQM methodology computes the spot rates so as to make them consistent with the yields on other high quality bonds. The HQM yield curve uses data from a set of high quality corporate bonds rated AAA, AA, or A that accurately represent the high quality corporate bond market.
