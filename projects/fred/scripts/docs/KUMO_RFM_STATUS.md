# Kumo RFM Integration - Status Report

## What We Fixed

### 1. Deduplication
- **Problem**: Same series appearing multiple times (PERMIT 3x, HOUST 2x)
- **Solution**: Added `.drop_duplicates(subset=['series_id'], keep='first')` to all recommendation methods
- **Result**: Each series now appears only once in results

### 2. Search Term Assistant
- **Auto-generated filenames**: No more manual input, creates slug from first 5 words
- **Working LLM responses**: Fixed Ollama integration, updated to `llama3.2` model
- **Better UX**: Shows filename immediately after first message

### 3. CLI Database Tool
- **Mode switching**: Type `viz` or `switch <mode>` to move between modes without going back
- **Data persistence**: Query results carry over when switching modes
- **Better prompts**: Each mode shows available commands clearly

## Current State

### What Works

**Text-based Recommendations**
```bash
python 05_kumo_rfm_integration.py --recommend 'housing' --top-k 15
```

- Keyword matching across titles and categories
- Popularity-based ranking
- No duplicates
- Relevant results (all housing-related)
- Fallback when Kumo prediction fails

**Example Output:**
```
PERMIT - New Privately-Owned Housing Units Authorized (Pop: 82)
HOUST - New Privately-Owned Housing Units Started (Pop: 80)
ACTLISCOUUS - Housing Inventory: Active Listing Count US (Pop: 79)
FIXHAI - Housing Affordability Index (Pop: 72)
...
```

### What Doesn't Work Yet

**Kumo RFM Predictions**
- Kumo API returns "Internal Server Error" for predictions
- Likely issue: Static data without timestamps
- Graph shows "0 edges" - no relationships between series

**Root Cause:**
- FRED metadata is static (no temporal dimension)
- Kumo RFM excels at temporal predictions
- Need time-series data or explicit relationships

## Value Proposition

### Short Term: Valuable as Search/Filter Tool
- Better than manual FRED search
- Pre-ranked by actual usage (popularity)
- Fast and reliable
- Good for discovery

### Long Term: Potential for Graph-Based Intelligence
Once we add time-series data or relationships:
- **Similar series**: "Users who viewed GDP also viewed unemployment"  
- **Complementary indicators**: "Complete your analysis with these series"
- **Trend predictions**: "This series is gaining popularity"
- **Explanations**: "Recommended because..."

## Next Steps to Unlock Full Potential

### Option 1: Add Time-Series Data
```python
# Include actual observations, not just metadata
series_data = {
    'series_id': 'GDP',
    'date': '2024-01',
    'value': 26500.0,
    'popularity_at_time': 85
}
```

Benefits:
- Kumo can learn temporal patterns
- Predict which series will trend
- Find lagging/leading indicators

### Option 2: Add Explicit Relationships
```python
# Co-viewed series
user_views = {
    'user_id': 'analyst_123',
    'series_id': 'GDP',
    'viewed_at': '2024-01-15'
}

# Or category relationships
relationships = {
    'source_id': 'GDP',
    'target_id': 'UNRATE',
    'type': 'related',
    'strength': 0.9
}
```

Benefits:
- Graph with actual edges
- Collaborative filtering
- "Users who viewed X also viewed Y"

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach (Recommended)
1. Keep current system as **fast search**
2. Add relationship edges for **graph traversal**
3. When time-series data available, enable **predictions**

## Files Modified

- `05_kumo_rfm_integration.py` - Added deduplication, better error handling
- `search_term_assistant.py` - Auto-filenames, fixed Ollama, better UX
- `051_kumo_rfm_cli.py` - Mode switching, data persistence
- `CHATBOT_USAGE.md` - Complete usage guide
- `.env.example` - Added API key placeholders

## Usage Examples

### Current Recommendation System
```bash
# Text query
python 05_kumo_rfm_integration.py --recommend 'inflation housing' --top-k 10

# Category exploration  
python 05_kumo_rfm_integration.py --category Employment --top-k 10

# Similar series (uses same category + popularity)
python 05_kumo_rfm_integration.py --similar PAYEMS --top-k 10
```

### Search Term Assistant
```bash
# Ollama (local, free)
python search_term_assistant.py --provider ollama

# Claude API
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY='your-key'
python search_term_assistant.py --provider claude

# Output: i_want_to_analyze_housing_20251029_163244.txt
```

### Database CLI
```bash
python 051_kumo_rfm_cli.py

# In augment mode:
augment> SELECT * FROM endpoints LIMIT 10;
y
augment> viz                    # Switch to visualize
viz> plot bar                  # Create chart
viz> export results.csv        # Save data
```

## Recommendation: Current Value

**Use it now for:**
- Quick FRED series discovery
- Popularity-based recommendations  
- Category exploration
- Interactive chat to find indicators

**Wait for Kumo RFM when:**
- You have time-series observation data
- You want predictive recommendations
- You need graph-based explanations
- You're tracking evolving trends

The system is **production-ready as a search/filter tool** with smart ranking by popularity. Kumo RFM predictions will add intelligence once we have temporal or relational data.
