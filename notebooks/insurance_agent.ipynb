    "\n",
    "1. **Data Ingestion & Graph Materialization**  \n",
    "   Load S3 Parquet files into a `KumoRFM` graph, validate schemas, and summarize the resulting graph.\n",

    "3. **Policy bundling recommendation**  \n",
    "   Predict which policies at-risk users are most likely interested in, leveraging predictive queries and table lookups.\n",

    "\n",
    "## STEP 1: Setup and Authentication\n",
    "1. Start by authenticating with the KumoRFM system using `kumo-rfm:authenticate` tool\n",
    "2. Find all table files in the data directory using `kumo-rfm:find_table_files` \n",
    "3. Inspect all tables using `kumo-rfm:inspect_table_files` to understand the data structure\n",
    "\n",
    "## STEP 2: Graph Design and Setup\n",
    "4. Use your domain knowledge to determine optimal graph structure:\n",
    "   - Identify primary keys and time columns for each table\n",
    "   - Determine appropriate semantic types for each column\n",
    "   - Map foreign key relationships between tables\n",
    "5. Explain your chosen graph structure and reasoning\n",
    "6. Initialize the graph using `kumo-rfm:update_graph_metadata` to:\n",
    "   - Add all tables with correct primary keys and time columns\n",
    "   - Set appropriate semantic types for each column\n",
    "   - Create foreign key-primary key links between tables\n",
    "7. Materialize the graph using `kumo-rfm:materialize_graph`\n",
    "\n",
    "## STEP 3: Renewal Prediction Analysis\n",
    "8. Predict likelihood of each customer renewing their policy in next 60 days using PQL query:\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   PREDICT COUNT(policies.*, 0, 60, days) > 0 \n",
    "   FOR customers.customer_id IN (customer_list) \n",
    "   WHERE COUNT(policies.*, -365, 0, days) > 0\n",

    "   - MEDIUM RISK: 30-70% renewal probability  \n",
    "   - LOW RISK: > 70% renewal probability\n",

    "11. For ALL customers (not just those likely to renew), predict which insurance products they're most interested in using:\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    PREDICT LIST_DISTINCT(policies.product_id, 0, 60, days) RANK TOP 5 \n",
    "    FOR customers.customer_id IN (customer_list)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "12. Look up product names using `kumo-rfm:lookup_table_rows` on the products table\n",
    "13. Analyze cross-selling opportunities and identify top recommended products per customer\n",
    "\n",
    "## STEP 5: Personalized Email Generation\n",
    "14. Generate personalized retention emails for each customer that include:\n",
    "    - Professional, concise tone (no emojis or overly casual language)\n",
    "    - Acknowledgment of their expiring policy\n",
    "    - Renewal discount offer (15-25% off current policy)\n",
    "    - Bundle discount offer for their current + most recommended new product\n",
    "    - Clear call-to-action with contact information\n",
    "    - Sense of urgency but not pushy\n",
    "15. Customize each email based on:\n",
    "    - Customer's churn risk level (adjust discount percentage)\n",
    "    - Their top recommended product for bundling\n",
    "    - Professional insurance industry language\n",
    "\n",
    "## STEP 6: Strategic Summary\n",
    "16. Provide executive summary with:\n",
    "    - Overall churn risk assessment\n",
    "    - Revenue impact analysis\n",
    "    - Recommended immediate actions\n",
    "    - Success metrics to track\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Parameters:\n",
    "Data Path: {DATA_DIR}\n",
    "File Names: agents.csv, claim_reports.csv, claims.csv, customers.csv, pets.csv, policies.csv, products.csv, properties.csv, vehicles.csv\n",
    "Customer IDs: {CUSTOMER_IDs}\n",
    "\n",
    "## Expected Insurance Domain Knowledge:\n",
    "- Policies table connects customers to their insurance policies\n",
    "- Claims table tracks insurance claims made against policies\n",
    "- Products represent different insurance types (auto, home, renters, etc.)\n",
    "- Agents are insurance sales representatives\n",
    "- Properties, vehicles, pets are assets covered by specific policy types\n",
    "- Time columns are critical for preventing data leakage in predictions\n",
    "- Foreign keys typically follow pattern: policy_id links to policies, customer_id links to customers, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Success Criteria:\n",
    "- Graph must be properly structured with correct relationships\n",
    "- Predictions must use appropriate temporal windows\n",
    "- Emails must be professional and personalized\n",
    "- Analysis must provide actionable business insights\n",
    "- All steps must be executed in sequence with proper error handling\n",

    "## Setting up the main agentic loop\n",
    "The `async def main()` function orchestrates an AI insurance agent that combines LangGraph for agent management with MCP (Model Context Protocol) for tool integration. It creates a ReAct agent powered by Claude 3.5 Sonnet that can use real external tools through a persistent MCP session.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key workflow:\n",
    "The setup initializes Claude as the language model, establishes a persistent connection to MCP servers via `MultiServerMCPClient` client, and dynamically loads available tools. The persistent session is crucial - it maintains state across tool calls so the agent can build on previous work rather than starting fresh each time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### LangGraph streaming and parsing:\n",
    "Instead of waiting for a final result, `agent.astream()` provides real-time updates as the agent works. LangGraph streams back chunks containing different node types:\n",
    "* `\"agent\"` nodes: The AI's reasoning and planning process\n",
    "* `\"tools\"` nodes: Actual tool executions with both the tool name and results\n",
    "\n",
    "This streaming approach lets you watch the agent's decision-making in real-time. The `recursion_limit: 50` prevents infinite loops while allowing complex multi-step problem solving.\n",
